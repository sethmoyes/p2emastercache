### EVENT TWO: THE OGRE'S WRATH
**Setup:** A broad chamber with cracked pillars and the stench of rot.

**Read-Aloud:** A heavy thud shakes dust from the ceiling. A massive silhouette lumbers into view, dragging a crude weapon along the stone. The creature snorts, eyes narrowing as it notices you, and raises its club with a low, eager growl.

**Creature:** Ogre Warrior (Level 3, Common)  
https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=317

**GM Notes:** The ogre charges immediately, favoring the largest or most heavily armored PC. It fights brutally but without tactics. Uses Power Attack when it can.

---

### EVENT THREE: THE SCORPION'S LAIR

**Creature:** Giant Scorpion (Level 3, Common)  
https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=356

https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=413

---

### EVENT FIVE: THE GHOUL'S FEAST
**Setup:** A bloodstained corridor with gnawed bones scattered about.

https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=218

https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=241

---

### EVENT EIGHT: FALLING STONE

https://2e.aonprd.com/Hazards.aspx?ID=7
