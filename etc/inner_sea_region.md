# THE INNER SEA REGION: A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

*A detailed exploration of every nation, region, and territory surrounding the Inner Sea of Golarion*

---

## INTRODUCTION TO THE INNER SEA

The Inner Sea region encompasses the continent of Avistan and the northern third of Garund, both surrounding the body of water known as the Inner Sea. At its heart lies Absalom, the City at the Center of the World, a metropolis that has stood for over 4,000 years as a beacon of civilization and commerce. The Inner Sea region represents the cradle of human civilization on Golarion, where countless empires have risen and fallen, where gods have walked and died, and where the fate of the world has been decided time and again.

The region stretches from the frozen reaches of the Crown of the World in the north to the steaming jungles of the Mwangi Expanse in the south, from the mysterious Arcadian Ocean in the west to the trade-rich shores of the Obari Ocean in the east. This vast territory encompasses dozens of nations, hundreds of city-states, and countless smaller settlements, each with their own unique culture, history, and destiny. The farther one travels from Absalom, whether north or south, the farther one moves from cosmopolitan civilization—though exceptions always exist.

The Inner Sea itself serves as the lifeblood of trade and communication for the entire region. Six of the most powerful nations on Golarion—Absalom, Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira, and Taldor—line its shores, their navies constantly vying for dominance over its waters. The sea's strategic importance cannot be overstated: control of its shipping lanes means control of wealth, and control of wealth means power. Naval battles between these emerging world powers are commonplace, and piracy remains a constant threat to merchant vessels.

Climate across the Inner Sea region varies dramatically. In Avistan, weather patterns generally move from west to east, bringing moisture from the Arcadian Ocean. Cold rains fall in western and northwestern Avistan, west of the Mindspin Mountains, while the rain shadow created by these peaks is offset by the massive Lake Encarthan in the east. In Garund, weather also moves west to east, with the heaviest rainfall along the western coastline. North of the Barrier Wall, the land becomes arid desert, while to the south lie the lush jungles of the Mwangi Expanse. The perpetual hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego, which has raged since the death of Aroden in 4606 AR, dominates Garund's western coast, drenching the Sodden Lands and much of western Garund with endless rain.

The Inner Sea region has been the staging ground for countless wars over the past ten millennia. From the ancient conflicts of Thassilon and Azlant, through the rise and fall of empires like Osirion and Taldor, to the modern struggles between Cheliax and its former colonies, warfare has shaped the political landscape as surely as Earthfall shaped the physical one. Yet despite—or perhaps because of—this constant conflict, the region remains the most culturally and economically vibrant area of the known world, where adventurers, merchants, scholars, and conquerors all seek their fortunes.

## AVISTAN: THE NORTHERN CONTINENT

### ABSALOM - THE CITY AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD

Absalom stands as the greatest city in the Inner Sea region and perhaps all of Golarion. For more than 4,000 years, this metropolis has served as a showcase of the greatest treasures, most diverse peoples, and most significant historical events in the world. Founded by the living god Aroden in 1 AR when he raised the Starstone from the depths of the Inner Sea, Absalom has withstood countless sieges, invasions, and catastrophes, earning its reputation as the most defensible city in existence.

The city's population exceeds 300,000 souls, representing virtually every ancestry, culture, and nation found across Golarion. This incredible diversity makes Absalom a true melting pot where Chelish nobles rub shoulders with Osirian merchants, Varisian fortune-tellers, Mwangi explorers, and visitors from even more distant lands. The city is divided into numerous distinct districts, each with its own character: the wealthy Petal District where nobles maintain their estates, the bustling Coins district where commerce never sleeps, the scholarly Wise Quarter home to the Arcanamirium, the rough Puddles where the poor struggle to survive, and the mysterious Precipice Quarter built into the city's ancient walls.

Absalom's political structure is unique and complex. The city is ruled by the Grand Council, composed of representatives from the city's most powerful factions, noble houses, and districts. The Lord Primarch serves as the council's leader and the city's nominal ruler, though their power is constantly checked by the other council members. The city maintains its independence through a combination of military might—the city's walls have never been breached in 4,000 years—and political maneuvering, playing the great powers of the Inner Sea against each other to ensure no single nation can dominate it.

The Starstone Cathedral stands at the heart of Absalom, housing the Starstone itself—the meteorite that Aroden raised from the sea and which grants divinity to those worthy enough to reach it. The Test of the Starstone has been attempted by thousands over the millennia, but only four have succeeded: Aroden himself, Norgorber, Cayden Cailean, and Iomedae. The cathedral and its approaches are filled with deadly traps, magical wards, and reality-warping effects that have claimed countless lives. Despite this, hopeful aspirants continue to attempt the Test, driven by dreams of godhood.

Absalom's economy is the largest and most diverse in the Inner Sea region. The city serves as the primary hub for trade between Avistan and Garund, and its markets offer goods from across the world. The city mints its own currency, and Absalom's gold and silver coins are accepted throughout the region. Major industries include shipbuilding, banking, education, and the sale of recovered treasures from the countless ruins surrounding the city. The Pathfinder Society, headquartered in Absalom's Grand Lodge, employs thousands of adventurers to explore ancient sites and recover lost knowledge and artifacts, further enriching the city's coffers and libraries.

### ANDORAN - THE BIRTHPLACE OF FREEDOM

Andoran represents one of the youngest major powers in the Inner Sea region, having gained independence from Cheliax in 4669 AR during the chaos following Aroden's death. This nation of forests, rivers, and rolling hills has transformed itself from a Chelish colony into a beacon of democracy and individual liberty, standing in stark ideological opposition to its former master. Andoran's government, known as the People's Council, is elected by popular vote—a radical concept in a region dominated by monarchies, theocracies, and worse.

The nation's capital, Almas, serves as both its political heart and its largest city. Built along the Andoshen River, Almas combines the architectural grandeur inherited from its Chelish past with new construction reflecting Andoran's democratic ideals. The People's Palace, where the People's Council meets, stands as a symbol of the nation's commitment to representative government. The city's streets bustle with activity as merchants, craftsmen, and citizens from all walks of life participate in the vibrant economy and political discourse that defines modern Andoran.

Andoran's economy is built on several pillars. The vast Arthfell Forest provides timber for the nation's renowned shipbuilding industry, which produces some of the finest vessels in the Inner Sea. The nation's farms and orchards, particularly in the fertile Carpenden Plains, produce abundant food that feeds the population and provides exports. Mining operations in the Five Kings Mountains extract valuable ores and gems. However, Andoran's most controversial economic policy is its absolute prohibition on slavery—the nation actively works to disrupt the slave trade throughout the region, earning it enemies among nations like Cheliax and Katapesh that profit from such commerce.

The Steel Falcons represent Andoran's military might and its commitment to spreading freedom. This elite military force combines traditional army units with specialized groups like the Eagle Knights, who conduct covert operations to free slaves and undermine tyrannical regimes throughout the Inner Sea. The Gray Corsairs, Andoran's naval arm, patrol the waters around the nation and beyond, attacking slave ships and disrupting the operations of nations Andoran considers oppressive. These activities have made Andoran many enemies, but the nation's leaders believe that freedom is worth fighting for, even at great cost.

Religiously, Andoran is diverse, but certain deities find particular favor. Erastil is widely worshiped in rural communities, representing the nation's agricultural heritage. Iomedae attracts many followers among the military and those who fight for justice. Cayden Cailean, god of freedom and ale, is perhaps the most popular deity, embodying the nation's love of liberty and its rejection of oppression. The nation's religious tolerance extends to most faiths, though worship of Asmodeus and other evil deities associated with tyranny is strongly discouraged if not outright banned in some communities.

Andoran faces numerous challenges despite its idealistic vision. The nation's aggressive foreign policy has created tensions with powerful neighbors, particularly Cheliax, which views Andoran as a rebellious province that must eventually be brought back into the fold. The cost of maintaining the Steel Falcons and conducting operations throughout the region strains the national treasury. Internally, debates rage about how far Andoran should go in spreading its ideals—some argue for a more aggressive approach, while others counsel restraint and focus on strengthening the nation itself. Despite these challenges, Andoran remains committed to its vision of a world where all people live free.

### CHELIAX - THE INFERNAL EMPIRE

Infernal Cheliax remains one of the most powerful nations militarily in the Inner Sea region, despite having lost much of its former glory and territory. Once the greatest empire since Taldor, controlling vast swaths of Avistan and Garund, Cheliax has been reduced to a shadow of its former self—yet it remains a formidable force. The nation's control of the Arch of Aroden, the passage between the Inner Sea and the Arcadian Ocean, gives it a vital role in regional trade and military strategy. However, what truly sets modern Cheliax apart is its open alliance with the forces of Hell itself.

The transformation of Cheliax into an infernal state began with the death of Aroden in 4606 AR and the subsequent civil war that tore the empire apart. As the nation descended into chaos, House Thrune made a pact with the archdevil Asmodeus, gaining infernal support in exchange for transforming Cheliax into a nation dedicated to Hell's principles of law, tyranny, and diabolism. Queen Abrogail II, the current ruler, sits upon the Infernal Throne in the capital city of Egorian, her power backed by both mortal armies and infernal legions. The Chelish government operates as a strict hierarchy where position is determined by birth, power, and favor with the ruling house.

Egorian, the capital, exemplifies the nation's infernal character. The city's architecture combines the classical grandeur of Old Cheliax with newer structures incorporating infernal aesthetics—spikes, chains, and diabolic imagery adorn public buildings. The Imperial Palace dominates the city, a massive complex where Queen Abrogail holds court and conducts the dark rituals that maintain her pact with Asmodeus. The city's streets are patrolled by Hellknights, the feared enforcers of Chelish law, whose armor and methods strike terror into the hearts of criminals and dissidents alike. Beneath the city lie extensive dungeons where political prisoners and those accused of crimes against the state languish in conditions designed to break both body and spirit.

Westcrown, the former capital, tells a different story. Once the jewel of the empire, Westcrown was abandoned as the capital after Aroden's death, and much of the city has fallen into decay. The Council of Thieves effectively rules the city's underworld, while the official government struggles to maintain control. Many Wes

tcrown citizens remember the glory days before House Thrune's rise and quietly resist the infernal regime, making the city a hotbed of potential rebellion. The city's famous dottari (city guard) walk a fine line between enforcing Chelish law and maintaining order in a city that increasingly rejects the current government's legitimacy.

The Chelish economy remains robust despite the nation's reduced territory. The country's position controlling the Arch of Aroden allows it to levy tariffs on all shipping between the Inner Sea and the Arcadian Ocean, generating enormous revenue. Chelish shipyards produce warships that are among the finest in the world, and the nation's navy remains a dominant force. Agriculture in the heartland provides food for the population, while mining operations extract valuable resources. However, the nation's reliance on slavery and infernal pacts has made it a pariah among many other nations, limiting trade opportunities and creating economic challenges.

The Hellknights represent one of Cheliax's most distinctive institutions. These orders of law-focused warriors operate semi-independently from the government, though most are based in Cheliax and support House Thrune's rule. Each Hellknight order has its own focus and methods, but all share a fanatical dedication to law and order, even if that means employing brutal tactics. The Order of the Rack hunts down spellcasters who use magic irresponsibly, the Order of the Scourge fights corruption, and the Order of the Nail crushes rebellion wherever it appears. Hellknights are feared throughout the Inner Sea region, and their distinctive armor makes them instantly recognizable.

### TALDOR - THE FADED EMPIRE

Taldor, once the greatest empire the Inner Sea region had ever seen, now struggles to maintain relevance in a world that has moved beyond its glory days. For thousands of years, Taldor dominated the region, its armies conquering vast territories and its culture defining civilization itself. The empire's reach once extended from the Windswept Wastes in the east to what is now Cheliax in the west, and from the World's Edge Mountains in the north to the shores of the Inner Sea in the south. However, centuries of decadence, corruption, and military defeats have reduced Taldor to a fraction of its former size, and the nation now faces an uncertain future.

The capital city of Oppara embodies both Taldor's glorious past and its troubled present. The city's architecture showcases the height of classical design—marble columns, grand plazas, magnificent palaces, and beautiful gardens that have inspired imitators throughout the region. The Senate's Arch, the Stavian Palace, and the Kitharodian Academy stand as testaments to Taldan achievement. Yet beneath this beautiful facade lies decay: crumbling infrastructure, corrupt bureaucracy, and a nobility more concerned with social intrigue than governance. The city's famous Taldan Horse, a massive bronze statue, has become a symbol of the nation itself—impressive from a distance, but showing signs of age and neglect upon closer inspection.

Taldan society is rigidly stratified, with the aristocracy maintaining an iron grip on power and privilege. The Grand Prince rules from the Stavian Palace, but his authority is constantly challenged by powerful noble houses, each scheming to increase their own influence. The Senate, theoretically a representative body, has become a theater for aristocratic posturing rather than effective governance. Social mobility is nearly impossible—one's birth determines one's station in life, and the common people have little hope of improving their circumstances. This rigid hierarchy has created deep resentment among the lower classes, and whispers of revolution grow louder with each passing year.

The Taldan military, once the most feared force in the region, has declined along with the empire itself. The famed Taldan Phalanx, which once conquered nations, now struggles to defend the empire's remaining borders. Corruption within the officer corps means that positions are bought and sold rather than earned through merit. The navy, which once dominated the Inner Sea, has been surpassed by Cheliax and Andoran. Border conflicts with Qadira in the east have become routine, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. Many fear that Taldor's military weakness will eventually invite invasion from its more vigorous neighbors.

Despite its decline, Taldor retains significant economic power. The nation's agricultural heartland remains productive, and Taldan wine, grain, and horses are prized throughout the region. The city of Cassomir serves as a major port, connecting Taldor to trade routes throughout the Inner Sea and up the Sellen River. Taldan craftsmen still produce goods of exceptional quality, and the nation's banks and merchant houses wield considerable financial influence. However, much of this wealth flows to the aristocracy rather than being invested in infrastructure or military modernization, perpetuating the cycle of decline.

Culturally, Taldor's influence remains profound. The Taldan language serves as the common tongue throughout much of the Inner Sea region. Taldan fashion, architecture, and social customs have been adopted by nations across Avistan and Garund. The nation's bardic colleges, particularly the Kitharodian Academy, train performers who spread Taldan culture wherever they travel. Taldan opera, theater, and literature are considered the height of sophistication. In many ways, Taldor's cultural empire persists even as its political empire crumbles, and many Taldans take comfort in this fact even as they watch their nation's power fade.

### VARISIA - LAND OF ANCIENT MYSTERIES

Varisia represents one of the most diverse and mysterious regions in all of Avistan, a land where ancient ruins dot the landscape and magic seems to seep from the very ground. Unlike most regions of the Inner Sea, Varisia has never been unified under a single government. Instead, it consists of numerous independent city-states, tribal territories, and unclaimed wilderness, all existing in a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and trade relationships. This political fragmentation has allowed Varisia to maintain its independence from larger powers, though it also means the region lacks the military strength to defend itself against determined invasion.

The region's history stretches back over 10,000 years to the Thassilonian Empire, one of the earliest and most powerful human civilizations on Golarion. The runelords of Thassilon wielded magic of incredible power, building monuments that still stand today and conducting experiments that warped the very fabric of reality. When Earthfall destroyed their empire, it left behind countless ruins filled with treasures, knowledge, and dangers. These ruins attract adventurers, scholars, and treasure hunters from across the world, making Varisia a magnet for those seeking fortune and glory. However, many of these ruins remain inhabited by ancient guardians, undead, or worse, making exploration a deadly proposition.

Magnimar, the largest city in Varisia, serves as the region's commercial heart. Built in the shadow of the Irespan, a massive ancient bridge that stretches out over the Varisian Gulf, Magnimar is a city of ambition and opportunity. The city's government, led by the Council of Ushers and the Lord-Mayor, maintains a delicate balance between various factions including merchant guilds, noble houses, and criminal organizations. The city's position on the coast makes it a major trading hub, and its relatively open society attracts immigrants from throughout the region. The Irespan itself remains a mystery—no one knows where it once led or what purpose it served, but its massive pylons provide foundation for entire neighborhoods built into and around the ancient structure.

Korvosa, Varisia's other major city, presents a stark contrast to Magnimar. Founded as a Chelish colony, Korvosa maintains much of its Chelish character despite having gained independence. The city is built on a bluff overlooking the Jeggare River and is dominated by Castle Korvosa, home to the city's monarch. Korvosan society is more rigid and hierarchical than Magnimar's, with clear distinctions between the aristocracy, merchant class, and common people. The city's Acadamae, a school of magic specializing in conjuration, has a dark reputation for its willingness to summon and bind devils and other dangerous entities. Tensions between Korvosa and Magnimar run high, with both cities competing for dominance over the region.

Riddleport, the third major settlement, has earned a reputation as a haven for pirates, smugglers, and criminals of all sorts. The city is built around a natural harbor and is dominated by a massive arch of unknown origin that spans the harbor entrance. Riddleport has no formal government—instead, it is ruled by various crime lords who maintain an uneasy peace through a combination of mutual interest and mutual threat. The city's anything-goes atmosphere attracts those fleeing justice elsewhere, and its markets offer goods that would be illegal in more civilized locales. Despite its lawless reputation, Riddleport serves an important economic function as a port where goods can be traded without the taxes and regulations imposed by other cities.

The Varisian people themselves are a diverse group, but the traditional Varisians—nomadic fortune-tellers, performers, and traders—remain culturally distinct. These Varisians travel in colorful caravans, following ancient routes and maintaining traditions that predate even Thassilon. They are known for their skill in divination magic, their vibrant clothing and jewelry, and their music and dance. Many settled Varisians view their nomadic cousins with a mixture of nostalgia and disdain, seeing them as romantic but impractical. However, the nomadic Varisians possess knowledge of the land and its history that settled folk have forgotten, and wise travelers seek their counsel before venturing into Varisia's wilderness.

### USTALAV - THE LAND OF ETERNAL NIGHT

Ustalav stands as a nation perpetually shrouded in gloom, both literal and metaphorical. This land of mist-shrouded forests, crumbling castles, and haunted moors has earned a reputation as the most superstitious and fear-ridden nation in the Inner Sea region. Ustalav's history is one of conquest, occupation, and liberation, but the scars of its past—particularly its centuries-long occupation by the Whispering Tyrant—have never fully healed. The nation remains fragmented, divided into numerous counties that barely acknowledge the authority of the nominal central government, and plagued by undead, lycanthropes, and other horrors that emerge from its dark forests.

The nation's capital, Caliphas, sits on the shores of Lake Encarthan and serves as the seat of Prince Aduard Ordranti III, the current ruler. However, the Prince's authority extends little beyond the capital itself, and even there his power is checked by the Palatine Council, an assembly of nobles who jealously guard their privileges. Caliphas itself is a city of contrasts—elegant architecture and refined society exist alongside poverty, crime, and supernatural threats. The city's famous Quarterfaux Archives contain one of the most extensive collections of occult knowledge in the world, attracting scholars willing to brave Ustalav's dangers. The city's theaters and opera houses offer world-class entertainment, but performances often end early so patrons can return home before dark, when the city's true masters—vampires, ghosts, and worse—emerge.

Ustalav's counties each have their own character and challenges. Canterwall, in the south, serves as a buffer against the Whispering Tyrant's former domain and maintains a strong military presence. Vieland, in the west, is known for its vineyards and relative prosperity. Versex, in the north, borders the demon-haunted Worldwound and faces constant threats from that direction. Ardeal, in the east, is ruled by vampires who make little effort to hide their nature. Each county is ruled by a count or countess who maintains their own army, collects their own taxes, and makes their own laws, creating a patchwork of different legal systems and customs that makes travel through Ustalav confusing and dangerous.

The Whispering Tyrant's legacy haunts Ustalav in ways both literal and figurative. For centuries, the lich Tar-Baphon ruled the region with an iron fist, transforming it into a nightmare realm where the living served the dead. Though he was imprisoned in 3827 AR by the Shining Crusade, his influence persists. Undead continue to rise throughout the nation, particularly in areas close to his former stronghold of Gallowspire. Cults dedicated to the Tyrant operate in secret, working to free their master. The nation's people live in constant fear of the dead, and elaborate funeral rites are observed to prevent the deceased from rising. Many Ustalavs carry holy symbols and know prayers to ward off evil, and the sale of garlic, silver, and other protective items is a thriving business.

Ustalav's economy struggles under the weight of its supernatural problems. Agriculture is difficult in the nation's poor soil and short growing season, and farmers must contend with undead attacks and cursed land. The nation's forests provide timber, but logging camps frequently fall victim to werewolves and other monsters. Mining operations in the Hungry Mountains extract valuable ores, but miners must be constantly vigilant against underground threats. The nation's most reliable source of income comes from trade passing through on the way to other destinations, and from the sale of occult knowledge and artifacts recovered from ancient sites. However, this trade is insufficient to support the population, and many Ustalavs live in poverty.

Despite its troubles, Ustalav has produced some of the Inner Sea region's greatest scholars, particularly in the fields of medicine, alchemy, and the occult. The University of Lepidstadt is renowned for its medical school, where students learn anatomy through the dissection of corpses—a practice considered distasteful in many other nations. Ustalav alchemists have developed numerous compounds for fighting undead and treating supernatural afflictions. The nation's occultists have cataloged hundreds of types of undead, ghosts, and other supernatural entities, creating taxonomies and developing countermeasures. This knowledge is Ustalav's greatest export, sought by monster hunters and scholars throughout the world.

### BREVOY - THE DIVIDED KINGDOM

Brevoy is a relatively young nation, having existed in its current form only since 4499 AR when the dragon-riding conqueror Choral the Conqueror united the warring nations of Issia and Rostland under his rule. The nation sits in northeastern Avistan, bordered by the Lake of Mists and Veils to the west, Numeria to the east, and the River Kingdoms to the south. Brevoy's history is one of conquest, uneasy unity, and recent crisis—the mysterious disappearance of House Rogarvia, the ruling dynasty descended from Choral himself, has thrown the nation into political turmoil and threatens to tear it apart once more.

The nation is divided both geographically and culturally between its northern and southern halves. Northern Brevoy, the former nation of Issia, is a land of rolling hills, dense forests, and harsh winters. The Issians are a pragmatic, sometimes ruthless people who value strength and cunning. They have traditionally dominated Brevoy's politics and economy, controlling most of the nation's trade and wielding disproportionate influence in the government. Southern Brevoy, the former Rostland, consists of vast grasslands known as the Rostland Plains. The Rostlanders are a more idealistic people, valuing honor, tradition, and martial prowess. They have long chafed under Issian dominance and see themselves as the true heirs to Brevoy's glory.

New Stetven, the capital, sits in northern Brevoy and serves as the seat of House Surtova, which has claimed the throne following House Rogarvia's disappearance. The city is built along the shores of the Lake of Mists and Veils and serves as Brevoy's primary port for trade with the River Kingdoms and beyond. The Ruby Fortress, home to the Surtovas, dominates the city's skyline. However, House Surtova's claim to the throne is contested by several other noble houses, and the city seethes with political intrigue as various factions maneuver for advantage. The Surtova's rule is maintained more through political maneuvering and the threat of civil war than through genuine legitimacy or popular support.

Restov, the largest city in southern Brevoy, serves as the cultural heart of Rostland and a center of opposition to Surtova rule. The city is famous for its Aldori swordlords, masters of the dueling sword who have developed their own distinctive fighting style. The Aldori Academy trains swordsmen from across the region, and graduation from the academy is considered a mark of great prestige. Restov's leaders have been careful not to openly rebel against New Stetven, but they provide support to those who would challenge Surtova authority, and many believe that if civil war comes, Restov will be at the center of the conflict.

Brevoy's economy is based primarily on agriculture and trade. The Rostland Plains produce vast quantities of grain, making Brevoy one of the breadbaskets of northern Avistan. The nation's position between the Lake of Mists and Veils and the River Kingdoms makes it a natural trade hub, and Brevic merchants have established trading posts throughout the region. The nation also profits from the export of furs, timber, and other resources from its northern forests. However, the political instability following House Rogarvia's disappearance has disrupted trade and caused economic uncertainty, and many merchants are moving their operations to more stable regions.

The mystery of House Rogarvia's disappearance hangs over Brevoy like a dark cloud. In 4699 AR, every member of the royal house vanished overnight without explanation. No bodies were found, no ransom demands were made, and no credible explanation has ever been offered. Some believe the house was destroyed by enemies, others that they were called away by their draconic heritage, and still others whisper of darker possibilities involving curses or divine intervention. Whatever the truth, the disappearance has created a succession crisis that threatens to plunge Brevoy into civil war. House Surtova's claim to the throne is based on being the most powerful remaining noble house, but several other houses have their own claims, and the longer the crisis continues, the more likely violent conflict becomes.

### NUMERIA - THE LAND OF FALLEN STARS

Numeria is a harsh, barren land unlike any other in the Inner Sea region, a place where ancient technology and savage barbarism exist side by side in an uneasy and often violent relationship. The nation's defining characteristic is the presence of countless technological artifacts that fell from the sky during the Age of Darkness when a massive spacecraft crashed into Golarion. These artifacts, made of strange metals and powered by incomprehensible energies, have shaped Numerian society in profound ways, creating a culture that is simultaneously primitive and advanced, superstitious and scientific.

The nation is ruled by the Black Sovereign, a title held by whoever can claim it through strength and cunning. The current Black Sovereign, Kevoth-Kul, rules from the capital city of Starfall, built around the largest piece of the crashed spacecraft. However, his rule is largely nominal outside the capital—Numeria is divided into numerous tribal territories, each controlled by a warlord who acknowledges the Black Sovereign's authority only when convenient. These tribes constantly war with each other over territory, resources, and technological artifacts, creating a state of perpetual low-level conflict that prevents Numeria from becoming a unified threat to its neighbors.

Starfall itself is a city of stark contrasts. The Silver Mount, the massive spacecraft fragment that dominates the city, rises hundreds of feet into the air, its metal hull still intact after millennia. The Technic League, an organization of wizards and technologists, controls access to the Silver Mount and jealously guards its secrets. They have learned to use some of the technology found within, creating weapons and devices that give them power far beyond what their numbers would suggest. The League effectively rules Starfall and, through their control of technology, exerts influence throughout Numeria. However, their rule is maintained through fear and force, and they are widely hated by the common people.

The Kellid tribes that make up the majority of Numeria's population live much as their ancestors did thousands of years ago, following herds of megafauna across the plains and gathering in temporary settlements. However, they have incorporated technological artifacts into their culture in strange ways. A tribal chief might wear a suit of ancient armor powered by incomprehensible energies, or a shaman might use a technological device as a focus for their magic. The tribes view technology with a mixture of reverence and fear, seeing it as both a source of power and a curse that has brought suffering to their land. Many tribes have taboos against using certain types of technology, while others actively seek out artifacts to increase their power.

The crashed spacecraft scattered debris across a vast area, and technological artifacts can be found throughout Numeria. Some are small and relatively harmless—strange tools, unusual materials, or devices whose purpose is unclear. Others are incredibly dangerous—weapons that can disintegrate matter, robots that still follow their ancient programming, or installations that warp reality itself. The most dangerous sites are the spacecraft's main sections, which contain functioning systems and active defenses that have killed countless treasure hunters. The Technic League maintains a monopoly on exploration of these sites, using their knowledge and resources to claim the most valuable finds while preventing others from accessing them.

Numeria's relationship with its neighbors is complex and often hostile. Brevoy to the west views Numeria as a source of both danger and opportunity—Numerian raiders sometimes cross the border, but Brevic merchants also trade for technological artifacts. Ustalav to the southwest fears Numerian barbarism and the strange powers wielded by the Technic League. The River Kingdoms to the south have a more pragmatic relationship, trading with Numerian tribes and sometimes hiring Numerian mercenaries. However, all of Numeria's neighbors share a common concern: what would happen if the nation were ever truly unified under a strong leader who could harness its technological power? Such a Numeria could threaten the entire region, and many foreign powers work to ensure that Numeria remains divided and weak.

### MENDEV - THE CRUSADER STATE

Mendev stands as the first and last line of defense against the Worldwound, a massive planar rift that spews forth demons in endless hordes. This nation has been transformed by its proximity to the Abyss, evolving from a relatively peaceful kingdom into a militarized crusader state where every aspect of society is oriented toward the eternal war against demonkind. Mendev's capital, Nerosyan, has become a fortress city where crusaders from across Golarion gather to fight in what many see as the most important conflict in the world—a battle not just for territory, but for the very survival of the material plane.

The Worldwound itself was created in 4606 AR when the death of Aroden weakened the planar barriers and allowed the demon lord Deskari to tear open a rift between Golarion and the Abyss. The rift appeared in what was once the nation of Sarkoris, transforming that land into a hellscape of twisted terrain and demonic corruption. Demons poured through the rift in numbers that seemed endless, overwhelming Sarkoris's defenses and threatening to spread across all of Avistan. Only the heroic efforts of Mendev's defenders, supported by crusaders from across the world, prevented the demons from advancing further. For over a century, the crusaders have held the line, but the cost has been terrible, and many wonder how much longer they can endure.

Nerosyan, the Diamond of the North, serves as both Mendev's capital and the headquarters of the crusade against the Worldwound. The city is surrounded by massive walls designed to withstand demonic assault, and every building is constructed with defense in mind. The city's population is swollen with crusaders, refugees from the Worldwound, and support personnel needed to maintain the war effort. Queen Galfrey, who has ruled Mendev for over a century through a combination of divine blessing and sheer determination, leads both the nation and the crusade from her palace in the city's heart. The city's streets are filled with warriors from dozens of nations, priests of good-aligned deities, and merchants selling weapons and supplies to the crusaders.

The crusade against the Worldwound is organized into several distinct groups, each with its own focus and methods. The Mendevian Crusaders form the core of the defensive forces, professional soldiers who have dedicated their lives to holding the line against the demons. The various knightly orders, including the Order of the Sunrise Sword and the Order of the Flaming Lance, provide elite shock troops for offensive operations. The Riftwardens, a group of arcane spellcasters, work to understand and potentially close the Worldwound itself. The Everbright Crusaders focus on healing and support, tending to the wounded and providing spiritual guidance. These groups don't always work together smoothly—rivalries, theological disputes, and competition for resources create friction—but they are united in their determination to defeat the demons.

Life in Mendev is hard even for those not directly involved in the fighting. The nation's economy is entirely focused on supporting the war effort, with agriculture, mining, and manufacturing all oriented toward producing food, weapons, and supplies for the crusaders. Taxes are high, and able-bodied citizens are expected to serve in the military or support roles. The constant threat of demonic attack means that even cities far from the Worldwound maintain strong defenses and regular patrols. The psychological toll of living under constant threat has created a society that is simultaneously deeply religious and prone to paranoia—demon cultists are seen everywhere, and accusations of corruption or collaboration with the enemy can ruin lives even when unfounded.

Despite the grim circumstances, Mendev has become a melting pot of cultures and faiths. Crusaders from Taldor, Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, and dozens of other nations fight side by side, bringing their own traditions and perspectives. The worship of Iomedae, goddess of justice and valor, dominates, but temples to Torag, Sarenrae, Shelyn, and other good-aligned deities can be found throughout the nation. This diversity has enriched Mendevian culture, but it has also created tensions as different groups compete for influence and resources. The question of what will happen to Mendev if the Worldwound is ever closed—or if the demons finally break through—haunts the nation's leaders, but for now, survival is the only goal that matters.

## GARUND: THE SOUTHERN CONTINENT

### OSIRION - THE LAND OF PHARAOHS

Osirion stands as one of the oldest continuous civilizations in the Inner Sea region, with a history stretching back over 8,000 years. This desert nation along the Sphinx River has seen the rise and fall of countless dynasties, weathered foreign occupation, and emerged as an independent kingdom once more. Osirion is a land of ancient pyramids, buried tombs, and forgotten magic, where the past is never truly dead and adventurers from across the world come seeking the treasures and knowledge of ages long past.

The nation's capital, Sothis, sits at the delta where the Sphinx River meets the Inner Sea. This ancient city has been continuously inhabited for millennia and serves as both the political heart of Osirion and its primary port. The city is dominated by the Black Dome, a massive structure of unknown origin that predates even the earliest Osirian dynasties. The current Ruby Prince, Khemet III, rules from the Crimson Palace, having restored Osirian independence after centuries of Keleshite occupation. Sothis is a city of contrasts—ancient monuments stand alongside modern buildings, wealthy merchants live in luxury while the poor struggle in the slums, and traditional Osirian culture mixes with influences from across the Inner Sea.

Osirion's economy is built on several foundations. Agriculture along the Sphinx River provides food for the population, with the annual flooding of the river depositing nutrient-rich silt that makes the land incredibly fertile. Trade through Sothis connects Osirion to markets throughout the Inner Sea and beyond, with Osirian merchants known for their shrewd business sense. However, the nation's most distinctive economic activity is the sale of exploration rights to ancient tombs and ruins. The Ruby Prince has opened many previously restricted sites to foreign adventurers, requiring them to purchase licenses and turn over a portion of their finds to the state. This policy has made Osirion a magnet for treasure hunters while also enriching the national treasury.

The ancient tombs and pyramids that dot the Osirian desert are both the nation's greatest treasure and its greatest danger. These structures were built by pharaohs and nobles of past ages to house their remains and the wealth they would need in the afterlife. They are protected by elaborate traps, magical wards, and undead guardians that have claimed the lives of countless tomb robbers over the millennia. Despite these dangers, the lure of ancient treasure and lost knowledge draws adventurers from across the world. Some seek gold and magical items, others search for historical artifacts and ancient texts, and still others hope to unlock the secrets of Osirian magic and engineering.

Osirian society maintains many ancient traditions while also adapting to the modern world. The worship of the old Osirian gods—particularly Abadar, Nethys, and Pharasma—remains strong, though other faiths have also found followers. The nation's legal system is based on ancient codes that have been updated and modified over millennia but still retain their essential character. Social hierarchy is important, with clear distinctions between nobles, priests, merchants, craftsmen, and laborers, though there is more social mobility than in some other nations. The Ruby Prince's reforms have modernized many aspects of Osirian society, but traditionalists resist changes they see as abandoning the nation's heritage.

The relationship between Osirion and its past is complex. On one hand, Osirions take great pride in their ancient civilization and see themselves as the inheritors of a glorious legacy. On the other hand, the constant presence of the past—in the form of undead, curses, and ancient magic—creates real dangers. Many Osirions view the opening of tombs to foreign adventurers with mixed feelings: it brings wealth and helps recover lost knowledge, but it also feels like selling their heritage to outsiders. The question of how to honor the past while building a prosperous future continues to shape Osirian politics and culture.

### KATAPESH - THE MARKET OF THE WORLD

Katapesh is a nation built on trade, where anything can be bought or sold if the price is right. Located on the northern coast of Garund, east of Osirion, Katapesh serves as a crossroads between the Inner Sea region, the nations of the Golden Road, and the mysterious lands to the south and east. The nation's capital, also called Katapesh, is one of the largest and most diverse cities in the world, a place where merchants from a hundred nations haggle in a dozen languages and goods from across Golarion change hands in deals worth fortunes.

The city of Katapesh is dominated by its markets, particularly the famous Nightstalls, a massive bazaar that operates around the clock. Here, one can find virtually anything: spices from distant Vudra, silks from Tian Xia, weapons from Qadira, magical items from Nex, slaves from Cheliax, and stranger goods besides. The city's architecture reflects its mercantile character—warehouses, trading houses, and market stalls dominate, while residential areas are often cramped and poorly maintained. The Golden Mosque, dedicated to Abadar, god of commerce, stands as the city's most impressive religious structure, its golden dome visible from miles away.

Katapesh is ruled by the Pactmasters, mysterious beings who have governed the nation for centuries. No one knows the Pactmasters' true nature—they appear as robed figures whose faces are never seen, and they communicate through intermediaries. Despite this mystery, their rule has been remarkably stable and effective. They maintain order through a combination of the city guard, mercenary companies, and their own mysterious powers. The Pactmasters' laws are simple: pay your taxes, don't disrupt trade, and don't ask questions about the Pactmasters themselves. Beyond these basics, almost anything is permitted, creating a society that is simultaneously orderly and anarchic.

The nation's economy is almost entirely based on trade. Katapesh's position makes it a natural hub for commerce between the Inner Sea, the Golden Road nations, and points beyond. The nation imposes relatively low tariffs and few trade restrictions, making it attractive to merchants who find other nations' regulations burdensome. However, Katapesh's most controversial trade is in slaves. The nation is one of the largest slave markets in the region, and while this brings enormous profits, it has also made Katapesh a target for abolitionists, particularly from Andoran. The slave trade creates moral complications even for those who profit from it, and debates about its continuation divide Katapeshi society.

Katapesh is also known for its production and trade of pesh, a drug derived from a cactus that grows in the nation's deserts. Pesh provides euphoric effects and is highly addictive, making it both popular and controversial. The pesh trade is controlled by powerful cartels that wield enormous influence in Katapeshi politics and society. These cartels maintain private armies, bribe officials, and eliminate competitors through violence when necessary. The Pactmasters tolerate the pesh trade as long as it doesn't disrupt other commerce, but the cartels' power has grown to the point where some wonder if they might eventually challenge the Pactmasters themselves.

Life in Katapesh is defined by opportunity and danger in equal measure. Fortunes can be made overnight through a successful trade deal, but they can also be lost just as quickly. The city attracts ambitious merchants, desperate refugees, cunning criminals, and everyone in between. The lack of strong moral or legal restrictions means that those willing to engage in questionable practices can prosper, but it also means that there is little protection for the weak or vulnerable. Katapesh is a city that rewards the clever and ruthless while crushing the naive and principled, making it both exciting and terrifying in equal measure.

### RAHADOUM - THE GODLESS NATION

Rahadoum stands unique among the nations of the Inner Sea region as a land that has completely rejected the worship of gods. This desert nation on Garund's northern coast has banned all religious practice, expelled all priests, and destroyed all temples in a radical experiment in secular governance. The nation's founding principle, known as the Laws of Mortality, holds that the gods have brought only suffering to humanity and that mortals must rely on themselves rather than divine intervention. This philosophy has shaped every aspect of Rahadoumi society and made the nation both fascinating and controversial.

The capital city of Azir sits on the coast and serves as the seat of the Keeper of the First Law, Rahadoum's ruler. The city's architecture deliberately avoids any religious symbolism, and its public spaces are designed to celebrate human achievement rather than divine glory. The city is clean, orderly, and prosperous, with well-maintained infrastructure and efficient government services. The Pure Legion, Rahadoum's military and police force, maintains order and enforces the Laws of Mortality with unwavering dedication. The city's markets offer goods from across the region, and Rahadoumi merchants are known for their honesty and reliability—in a nation without gods, one's reputation is everything.

The Laws of Mortality are enforced strictly throughout Rahadoum. Possession of religious texts, holy symbols, or other religious paraphernalia is illegal and punishable by exile or imprisonment. Priests and other divine spellcasters are forbidden from entering the nation, and those discovered practicing religion are given a choice: renounce their faith or leave. The Pure Legion maintains a network of informants to detect religious activity, and citizens are encouraged to report violations. This creates an atmosphere of suspicion and surveillance that some find oppressive, though supporters argue it is necessary to maintain the nation's principles.

Despite the ban on religion, Rahadoum has developed its own philosophical and ethical traditions to fill the void left by the gods. The nation's scholars have created elaborate systems of ethics based on reason and human welfare rather than divine commandment. Rahadoumi philosophers debate questions of morality, justice, and the good life in academies and public forums. The nation has also developed advanced medical and alchemical knowledge, seeing these as superior to divine healing. Rahadoumi hospitals and alchemists are among the best in the world, and their techniques have been adopted by other nations even if their philosophy has not.

Rahadoum's economy is based on agriculture, trade, and the export of alchemical goods. The nation's position on the coast makes it a natural trading hub, and Rahadoumi merchants have established trading posts throughout the region. The nation's farms, irrigated by an elaborate system of canals and aqueducts, produce dates, olives, and other crops suited to the desert climate. Rahadoumi alchemists produce medicines, antitoxins, and other compounds that are highly sought after. The nation's prosperity demonstrates that a society can function without religion, though critics argue that this prosperity comes at the cost of spiritual impoverishment.

The question of whether Rahadoum's experiment will ultimately succeed remains open. The nation has existed for over 2,000 years, suggesting that a godless society can be stable and prosperous. However, the nation faces challenges both internal and external. Some Rahadoumis secretly practice religion, risking everything to maintain their faith. Foreign powers, particularly theocracies like Razmiran, view Rahadoum as an abomination that must be destroyed. And philosophical questions remain: Can a society truly flourish without the transcendent meaning that religion provides? Or has Rahadoum discovered a better path forward for humanity? These questions continue to drive debate both within Rahadoum and throughout the Inner Sea region.

### THE MWANGI EXPANSE - THE UNTAMED JUNGLE

The Mwangi Expanse is not a single nation but rather a vast region of jungle, savanna, and swamp that covers much of central Garund. This is a land of incredible diversity—dozens of distinct cultures, hundreds of city-states and tribal territories, and countless ruins from civilizations that rose and fell long before recorded history. The Expanse is bordered by more organized nations to the north and east, but its interior remains largely unexplored by outsiders, a green hell where ancient magic still holds sway and dangers lurk behind every tree.

The Expanse's geography is as varied as its peoples. The northern reaches consist of savanna and scrubland, gradually transitioning to dense jungle as one moves south. The Vanji River and its tributaries provide transportation routes through the jungle, though they are fraught with dangers ranging from crocodiles to river pirates. Ancient ruins dot the landscape—crumbling cities built by the Shory, the Mwangi, and even older civilizations. Some of these ruins are inhabited by descendants of their builders, others by monsters or worse. The jungle itself seems almost alive, with plants and animals that exist nowhere else in the world.

The peoples of the Mwangi Expanse are incredibly diverse. The Mwangi themselves are not a single ethnic group but rather a collection of related peoples with their own distinct cultures, languages, and traditions. The Zenj dominate the northern savannas, living in city-states that combine traditional culture with trade connections to the outside world. The Bonuwat inhabit the coastal regions, their culture shaped by the sea. The Bekyar, infamous as slavers and demon-worshipers, control territories in the southwest. Dozens of other groups—the Bas'o, the Kallijae, the Ombo, and many more—each have their own territories and ways of life. This diversity makes generalization about the Expanse impossible; each region must be understood on its own terms.

Several major settlements serve as points of contact between the Expanse and the outside world. Bloodcove, on the western coast, is a rough frontier town where Sargavan colonists, Mwangi natives, and pirates from the Shackles all mingle in an uneasy truce. Kibwe, on the shores of Lake Ocota, is a major Mwangi city-state that has maintained its independence and traditional culture while engaging in trade with outsiders. Nantambu, home to the Magaambya, the oldest school of magic in the Inner Sea region, attracts students from across the world who seek to learn the unique magical traditions developed in the Expanse. Each of these settlements has its own character and challenges, serving as gateways to the deeper jungle.

The Expanse is home to dangers that would be considered legendary anywhere else. Dinosaurs, some of enormous size, roam the jungles and savannas. The angazhani, intelligent apes with a taste for human flesh, hunt in packs. The charau-ka, demon-worshiping ape-men, raid settlements and drag captives back to their jungle lairs. Ancient curses and wild magic warp the land in unpredictable ways. Diseases unknown in other regions claim lives with terrifying speed. And beneath it all, the ruins of ancient civilizations hold treasures and knowledge—but also guardians and traps that have survived for millennia. The Expanse is not a place for the unprepared or the faint of heart.

Yet despite its dangers, the Mwangi Expanse holds incredible promise. The jungle's biodiversity includes plants with medicinal properties found nowhere else. The ancient ruins contain magical knowledge and artifacts that could revolutionize understanding of the arcane. The region's mineral wealth—gold, gems, and rare metals—remains largely untapped. And the cultures of the Expanse have developed philosophies, arts, and technologies that offer different perspectives on fundamental questions. The challenge is accessing these resources and knowledge without falling victim to the Expanse's many dangers or exploiting its peoples. As the Inner Sea region becomes increasingly interconnected, the Mwangi Expanse's role in the broader world continues to evolve.

## CONCLUSION

The Inner Sea region represents the heart of civilization on Golarion, a vast and diverse area where countless cultures, nations, and peoples interact in complex webs of trade, diplomacy, and conflict. From the frozen north to the steaming jungles of the south, from ancient empires to young democracies, from lands of law to realms of chaos, the region encompasses virtually every type of society and environment imaginable.

Each nation and region described here has its own unique character, challenges, and opportunities. Absalom stands as the cosmopolitan center, Andoran champions freedom, Cheliax embraces infernal tyranny, Taldor clings to faded glory, Varisia guards ancient mysteries, Ustalav battles the undead, Brevoy faces division, Numeria struggles with fallen technology, Mendev fights demons, Osirion excavates its past, Katapesh trades everything, Rahadoum rejects the gods, and the Mwangi Expanse remains largely untamed.

These nations do not exist in isolation. Trade routes connect them, diplomatic relationships bind them, and conflicts divide them. The death of Aroden in 4606 AR reshaped the political landscape, and the region continues to evolve. New powers rise while old ones decline. Alliances form and break. Wars erupt and end. Through it all, the Inner Sea remains the center of the known world, where the fate of Golarion is decided.

For adventurers, scholars, merchants, and anyone seeking their fortune, the Inner Sea region offers endless opportunities. Ancient ruins wait to be explored, political intrigues need to be unraveled, monsters must be defeated, and wrongs cry out to be righted. Whether one seeks gold, glory, knowledge, or justice, the Inner Sea region provides a stage grand enough for any ambition and dangerous enough to test even the mightiest heroes.
