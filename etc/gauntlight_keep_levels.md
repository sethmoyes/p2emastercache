**Location:** Near Otari, Isle of Kortos  
**Character Levels:** 1st to 11th level

## Overview

Gauntlight Keep is a pale stone lighthouse of indestructible smooth walls rising above foggy coastal ruins. Beneath it sprawls the Abomination Vaults, a massive 10-level megadungeon complex extending hundreds of feet underground. The ancient sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex built this fortress between 4230-4234 AR to raise an army of monsters to attack Absalom in revenge for her family's exile.

Though she was killed by the Roseguard in 4244 AR, Belcorra returned as a ghost on the 500th anniversary of her family's exile (4719 AR). She has been active for 2 years, working through will-o'-wisps and agents as she cannot leave the bottom three floors.

The dungeon reaches the Empty Vault - an ancient serpentfolk shrine to Nhimbaloth (the Empty Death) constructed during the Age of Darkness, raised with the Starstone Isles by Aroden.

**The Gauntlight Shaft:** A constant feature on all ten floors, the lighthouse shaft has smooth, indestructible walls different from every other floor's composition.

## Key NPCs & Factions

### Belcorra Haruvex
- **Born:** 4213 AR to wealthy Haruvex family in Absalom
- **Exiled:** 4219 AR (age 6) - family exiled for bloody sacrifices to Outer Gods
- **Returned:** 4230 AR (age 17) - built Gauntlight above Empty Vault
- **Completed:** 4234 AR (age 21) - Gauntlight finished, began gathering monster army
- **Died:** 4244 AR (age 31) - killed by Roseguard
- **Awakened:** 4719 AR - 500th anniversary of exile, most traumatic day
- **Current:** 4721 AR - active for 2 years, cannot leave bottom three floors

**Personality:** Product of family nurturing evil, consumed by revenge, guided by Nhimbaloth. Cartoonishly evil with no redemption (or make her more complex - family victim, loved ones, Outer God manipulation).

**Limitations as Ghost:** Restricted command/communication. Works through will-o'-wisps and agents. Only Voidglutton can directly communicate with her. Progress slow in 2 years - players catching her before she's ready.

### The Roseguard
Elite Absalom soldiers who killed Belcorra (4244 AR). Only fought top floor, never knew what was below.

**Members:**
1. **Aesephna Menhemes:** Female cleric of Erastil. Ancestor to Mayor Oseph and Dorianna. Icon: Hunter's Brooch (Oseph has it).
2. **Vol Rajani:** Female fighter, exiled Nidal royalty (Umbral Court). Ancestor to Carman Rajani. Icon: Cooperative Blade longsword (Dawnflower Library display).
3. **Zarmavdian:** Male wizard. Icon: The Thresholds of Truth spellbook (Odd Stories, Morlibint owns).
4. **Otari Ilvashi:** Male rogue. Fell through floor to Level 4, died there. Tools beside body. Town named after him.

**After Victory:** Raised Otari in friend's memory, retired there. Last Roseguard (Aesephna) died 4290 AR.

### Nhimbaloth (The Empty Death)
**Nature:** Outer God, predator of River of Souls. Hunts apex predators (astradaemons, night hags, devourers) who already consumed souls.

**Manifestation:** Appears in Material Plane during massive death events when River of Souls weakens. Prefers swamplands (metaphysically similar to river shores).

**Worship:** Mortals fear worse afterlife from Pharasma's judgment, seek Nhimbaloth's oblivion. Sadists enjoy mystery and despair. Most dangerous: those wanting to bring Deadtide and destroy world (Belcorra).

**Prevalence:** Not widely known, mostly backwater swamp cults. Even powerful people unaware. Explains why obvious shrine on Floor 1 doesn't raise eyebrows.

**Inspiration:** Algernon Blackwood's "The Willows" - influenced HP Lovecraft's cosmic horror.

**Nhimbaloth Throughout Vaults:**
- Floor 1: Public shrine
- Floor 2-3: Mossy skull elevator trigger
- Floor 3: The Whispering Reeds book, fulcrum lens notes
- Floor 4: Upper Temple, Spectral Barrier

- Floor 9: Gate of Nhimbaloth, Lady's Whisper
- Floor 10: The Empty Vault itself

## Major Factions

### Morlocks (Ghost Queen Worshippers)
**Origin:** Azlanti humans who fled to Darklands during Earthfall. Degenerative regression from inbreeding over thousands of years in isolation.

**Current:** Living in Darklands adjacent to vaults. Sensed Belcorra's return 2 years ago, came to worship her as "Ghost Queen". Fought Cult of the Canker, kicked mitflits from Floor 2.

**Mystery:** Why did morlocks sense her return but not library ghouls (Floor 3) or seugathi (Floor 6)?

**Key NPCs:**
- **King Graulgust:** Leader on Floor 2
- **Augrael:** Ghoulish morlock on Floor 3. Survived ghoul fight, contracted ghoul fever. Rejected by both groups. Tranquil, only wants to read and eat undead flesh. (Great recurring NPC - biracial metaphor)

**Fate:** Source of flesh for ghouls. Many imprisoned on Floors 5-6 awaiting fleshwarping to become dreshkans. Failed experiments become grothluts scattered throughout vaults.

### Ghouls (Cult of the Canker)
**Origin:** Belcorra's librarians, caretakers, scribes. Remained loyal after her death. Resorted to cannibalism when food ran out, contracted ghoul fever.

**Goal:** Resurrect Belcorra by collecting "cankerous flesh" to build flesh golem as her vessel.

**Problem:** Stuck in infinite loop - ravenously eat the flesh they need for golem. Currently using morlocks as source.

**Members:** All 500+ year old humans with pointy ears.
- **Nhakazarin (BOSS):** Belcorra's necromantic advisor, high priestess
- **Aller Rosk:** Belcorra's notary/scribe, skins and tattoos morlocks (makes them "tastier")
- **Various librarians and scribes**

**Location:** Floor 3 (The Library)

### Seugathi (Fleshwarpers)
**Origin:** Worm-like aberrations from Darklands. Met Belcorra during construction, eager to serve.

**Deal:** Perfect soldiers for Belcorra in exchange for knowledge pursuit. She repurposed Floor 6 from gladiator support to laboratories.

**Coup:** When Belcorra died, killed Tarkannah (bone devil controller). Jafaki leads, unaware of her return.

**Focus:** Maintaining Floor 6 domain, furthering fleshwarping studies. Arena (Floor 5) is dumping ground for failed experiments.

**Truce with Devils:** Brief war with Floor 7 until Urevian realized non-expansionist. Trade "raw materials" for "cast-off experiments" to join devil forces.

**Key NPCs:**
- **Jafaki (BOSS):** Male fleshwarper, Floor 6. Loyal drider assistant. Working on flesh golem with living morlock head.
- **Various researchers:** Guards, observers throughout Floor 6

**Location:** Floor 6 (Laboratories)

### Drow (Yldaris Settlement)
**Origin:** Common elves who stayed on Golarion during Earthfall instead of returning to Castrovel. Infused by Darklands radiation and Rovagug's brief awakening, became angry and bitter.

**Yldaris:** Settlement on Floor 9, tied to Lozardyn city in Darklands. Belcorra captured drow as hostages 500 years ago, made deal to protect Ochre Lens and aid Absalom attack.

**Current:** Granddaughter Quara leads, gives half-genuine renewal of promise.

**Paizo History:** Originally completely evil with fleshwarping (Dragon #298, Second Darkness AP 2008). Over time, attitudes changed. Abomination Vaults first non-evil drow, moved fleshwarping to seugathi. No more official drow content after leaving OGL.

**Key NPCs:**

- **Salaisa Malthulas:** Master warden, second-in-command, concerned about surface dwellers

- **Falxi Orshendiel:** Floor 6, rogue prisoner, distant cousin to Quara
- **Various hunters and wardens**

**Location:** Floor 9 (Yldaris Settlement)

### Urdefhan (War Champion's Forces)
**Origin:** Vampire-like warmongers created by First Horsemen of Apocalypse to serve as agents of end times. Worship rulers of Abaddon.

**Deal:** Belcorra attacked their cave, gained respect. Entrusted with Emerald Fulcrum Lens, passed down generations as leadership symbol.

**Current:** Led by war champion Khurfel with Emerald Lens on back.

**Four Horsemen of Apocalypse:**
1. **Apollyon:** Prince of Plagues (Pestilence)
2. **Charon:** Boatman of Styx (Death) - last original Horseman

Forsaken (Shadow Plane demigods) gave them Cradles of Night, transformed them to shadowy people. Forsaken planned to use souls to escape but disappeared from "mysterious calamity". Owbs (shadow creatures) took Forsaken's place, manipulating them.

**Current:** Refugees fleeing "deeper calamity" (loss of gods). Arrived years ago, split into two factions.

**Lodge Faction (Galudu):**
- Led by female mage Galudu
- Remained in stone lodge (Floor 9)

**Similarity:** Like morlocks, ancient Azlanti who went underground during Earthfall. Caligni to humans as drow to elves or duergar to dwarves.

**Locations:** Floor 8 (Cult), Floor 9 (Lodge)

### Velstracs (Bound Torturers)
**Origin:** Fiends born from selfish/depraved thoughts of earliest mortals. So hideous gods chained them to Hell. Betrayed by Hell factions, escaped to Shadow Plane. New velstracs born when sadistic/masochistic souls diverted from River of Souls.

**Belcorra's Binding:** Bound two velstracs 500 years ago for specific purposes.

**Key NPCs:**
- **Vaulgrist (Floor 4):** Bound for unspecified purpose. Tortured Lasda before Volluk took him. After 500 years, lost all energy/motivation. Won't fight if left alone. Her +1 ghost touch whip on table.

**Locations:** Floor 4 (Vaulgrist), Floor 5 (Cratonys)
