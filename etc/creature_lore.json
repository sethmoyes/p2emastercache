Despite being undead, ghouls harbour many of the needs that drive the living, though these needs are normally perverted in some sinister way. Ghouls are primarily motivated by hunger despite being dead with stomachs that stopped working long ago. This hunger is constant, never rising or falling, and ceasing only while consuming flesh.\n\nGhouls have a somewhat humanoid appearance, sharing the basic frame of the humanoid they were created from, although up close it is almost impossible to mistake a ghoul for a still-living person. All ghouls look emaciated and hungry, and despite their frequent feasting ghouls never gain weight and always look wiry. Their skin takes on the hue of bruised, pallid flesh. A ghoul's facial features also subtly change to become more elongated, with teeth that increase in both size and sharpness.\n\nThe bite of a ghoul can inflict ghoul fever, which causes the victim to suffer from great hunger but also renders them unable to keep down any food. Unless cured, the victim slowly starves to death and rises the next midnight as a ghoul."

It has even been suggested that they may once have been fey, cursed for their vanity and turned into crones.10 The fey fable of the Three sisters of Simarron tells a similar story.15\n\nHag offspring, known as changelings, are typically born when a hag tricks a male of another species into coupling with her. The hag normally murders and eats the changeling's father before he can ever see his child. After giving birth, the hag then abandons the child with a family or organisation of the father's ancestry that she believes will care for the child, such as a temple.1617 Changelings can also be born when a hag coven performs ritual magic near a settlement, and such babies are often soon abandoned or orphaned."

    "lore": "Resembling stony statues of winged monsters, gargoyles are airborne menaces in both civilised regions and remote wildernesses.2\n\nGargoyles resemble a stone statue of some hideous, malevolent creature. Most are humanoid with bat's wings, but individual gargoyles can take many forms, including those that do not resemble any known creature. They can remain so unnaturally still that they can pass as statues, and it takes a perceptive eye to distinguish them from normal, inanimate statues. A gargoyle's appearance very slowly shifts over time to adapt to its surroundings, which allows it to match the local architectural style13 or the surrounding stone of a wilderness region.4\n\nThe Ashwing gargoyles of the Cinderlands have smooth, wind-worn bodies with rippling ashen and brick-coloured patterns,45 while gargoyles of the Uwaga Highlands are chalky and pale to better resemble the Chalk Cliffs they call home.6"

Their fox-like tails can be almost as long as the rest of their bodies. Though they typically have red fur, their leaders often have white or black grey-flecked pelts. As consummate travelers, vulpinals dress practically-yet-stylishly, picking their favorite styles and accoutrements from their journeys.2"
