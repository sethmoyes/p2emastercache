Coming Together 3
Cosmic Caravan Pantheon 5
Otari Gazetteer 5
When the mysterious lighthouse called Gauntlight
glows with baleful light, the people of Otari
suspect that it’s an ominous prelude to sinister
events. Heroes must explore the ruins around
the lighthouse and delve into the dungeon levels
below. Hideous monsters, deadly traps, and
vengeful ghosts all await the heroes who dare
to enter the sprawling megadungeon called the
Abomination Vaults!
3
Coming Together
The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path begins near
the small town of Otari on the southern shore of the
Isle of Kortos. A robust and spoiler-free description of
the town can be found in this player’s guide. While this
gazetteer does mention things that aren’t frequently
discussed in polite company (such as the rough crew
that hangs out at the Crook’s Nook), the contents
of this gazetteer are considered common knowledge
among Otari’s citizens. It’s possible for some (or even
all) of the heroes to hail from Otari, but that isn’t
necessary. Although most of the campaign’s action
takes place in the dungeon about a half hour to the
north in the swampy Fogfen, the heroes will return
to Otari many times and should come to rely on its
people.
The heroes might or might not know each other, but
all of them should have a friend in common: the town’s
eccentric oddities merchant, Wrin Sivinxi. Wrin’s
mixture of tiefling and elven ancestry is impossible to
miss: her eyes are devoid of pupils, small ram horns
curl around her elven ears, and her fingertips sparkle
with motes of glittering light. Wrin is more than
a collector of unusual items and occult lore; she’s a
scholar of the stars who possesses curious foresight
about strange events (perhaps this foresight drove her
to build a friendship with the heroes in the first place).
In any case, once Wrin collects the heroes to tell them
of a strange light she has seen around Gauntlight, the
mysterious inland lighthouse deep in the Fogfen, the
campaign can begin!
ALIGNMENTS
There isn’t any restriction on character alignments in
the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The heroes
aren’t likely to be evil, as they should care about the
fate of Otari and its people, but characters of any
alignment could investigate strange clues and seek
their fortunes in dungeons.
ANCESTRIES
For being a small town, Otari has an exceptionally
open-minded view of people from elsewhere. In
part, this attitude is due to the town’s proximity to
the cosmopolitan metropolis of Absalom, only a
few days’ travel away. Townspeople in Otari might
consider other people strange—certainly, Wrin Sivinxi
is considered a good-natured eccentric by most—
but that’s due to personal behavior, not ancestry. As
the characters spend a lot of time delving into dark
dungeons, an ancestry with darkvision has advantages
but isn’t necessary. In short, any ancestry makes a
good fit for the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.
CLASSES
Members of any class will have plenty of moments
to shine in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path,
but keep in mind that dungeon-delving makes up
a significant part of the campaign. Characters who
excel at diplomacy or deception will certainly have
opportunities to talk their way out of dangerous
situations and make allies out of enemies, but
there’s not really a web of intrigue and influence in
the Vaults to support characters who excel at such
things. Characters who can handle themselves in a
fight with bizarre and monstrous foes will excel,
but so will knowledgeable characters like bards and
wizards who can unlock some of the mysteries the
dungeon presents. Traps and hidden doors abound
in dungeons, so a rogue makes an excellent addition
to any Abomination Vaults party.
In addition, each volume of the Abomination Vaults
Adventure Path contains a new archetype that heroes
might find useful, but discovering some of these
archetypes and unlocking access to them are parts of
the adventure!
LANGUAGES
Although Common will likely suffice for most heroes,
certain other languages might prove useful to know.
Aklo, Elven, and Undercommon all have some use
during this Adventure Path.
SKILLS AND FEATS
The heroes will perform best if their party contains a
well-rounded selection of skills and feats. Acrobatics
and Athletics are important for the physical mobility
required in dungeons, while Occultism can particularly
help to identify the strange creatures and decipher the
clues that await in this particular eldritch ruin. The
best Lore skills include Cavern Lore, Otari Lore, and
Spirit Lore, but many other Lore skills might come into
play. As far as good feats to take, Canny Acumen helps
to spot (or avoid!) dangers, while feats like Incredible
Initiative and Toughness make winning a fight much
more likely.
BACKGROUNDS
The following backgrounds are particularly suitable
to characters in the Abomination Vaults AdventurePLAYER'S GUIDEPLAYER'S GUIDE

PLANNING FOR THE END
The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path takes
characters from 1st level to 10th level and concludes
at about 11th level. There are certainly opportunities
to continue the campaign (such as with the Fists
of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path, which starts
at 11th level and begins in the next volume after
Abomination Vaults concludes). As such, keep in
mind that if you’ve got your eye on a particular
12th-level feat or 15th-level class feature, it’s not
something you’ll likely get the chance to select
during the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.
Path, although heroes can select any background
they choose and need not confine their selection to
those provided below. People come from all walks
of life to seek their fortunes, after all. Among the
backgrounds presented in the Core Rulebook, the
best choices are acolyte, bounty hunter, farmhand,
field medic, guard, hunter, martial disciple, miner,
nomad, or scout.
BIBLIOPHILE BACKGROUND
You love few things more than a good book, and as a result,
Odd Stories is your favorite shop in Otari. The bookseller
Morlibint supplies you with fiction, anthologies, and other
delightful reads, and he’s always eager to discuss his latest
finds with you. You know that imagination is the greatest
magic, but a working knowledge of actual magic helps, too.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Arcana skill and the Library Lore
skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat.
ELDRITCH ANATOMIST BACKGROUND
You’re a trained physician who can ably tend wounds of
many kinds. But more than a practitioner, you’re a scholar.
Some cultures shape flesh to extreme degrees, creating
aberrations from humanoid forms. The fleshforges of
distant Nex practice this fleshwarping, as do certain
subterranean societies you hope to one day study—
preferably from a safe and clinical distance.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Fleshwarp
Lore skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Medicine.
FOGFEN TALE-TELLER BACKGROUND
You know there are monstrous things out in the swamp
known as Fogfen; you’ve seen these things through
the mist, gliding through the murky water and heaving
themselves over sodden bits of land. No one in Otari
believes your tales of swamp monsters from the depths,
even when you embellish the creatures of your stories with
fangs, wings, or tentacles. You’ll just have to prove to them
that there are truly monsters out there, and that they were
wrong to doubt you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Athletics and the Swamp Lore skill. You
gain the Titan Wrestler skill feat.
MARKET RUNNER BACKGROUND
Keeleno Lathenar, the proprietor of Otari Market, is a
grim and bitter man. A werewolf named Jaul Mezmin
mauled his wife, Ayla, to death 30 years ago. Keeleno
has never forgotten nor forgiven this attack, and he
believes against all odds that Jaul has evaded justice and
is alive and well. Running errands for Keeleno around
town, you’ve gotten to know him almost as well as
you know Otari. Keeleno’s suspicions have rubbed off
on you a bit, so you keep a wary eye on other people—
particularly around the full moon.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution
or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Otari Lore
skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.
RUIN DELVER BACKGROUND
You’ve looked through some of the smaller ruins in the
Otari hinterlands but have never quite built up the courage
to check out the creepy lighthouse called Gauntlight.
You’ve heard that these ruins are pretty well picked over,
and mostly collapsed, but you always planned to some day
explore them and perhaps find some bauble left behind
from the centuries-old battle where the Roseguard slew
an evil sorcerer. You know that the crumbled stone of old
ruins has a tendency to shift, so you’d better step lightly if
you get the chance to explore Gauntlight.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Acrobatics and the Roseguard Lore
skill. You gain the Cat Fall skill feat.

the tales associated with the Cosmic Caravan and how the
heavens can predict the future. You know that Wrin has
paralyzing claustrophobia; she sees menace in angles and
danger in confined spaces, which is why her shop is an all
domed canvas that opens to the sky. If Wrin thinks there’s
trouble, you’ll be the first to offer to help.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution
or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Astrology
Lore skill. You gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.
WITCHLIGHT FOLLOWER BACKGROUND
While in a dismal forest or remote swamp, you caught
sight of a string of lights bobbing through the trees.
You stepped forward for a closer look, and then still
further when the lights retreated a few paces. Then you
remembered the rumors. Will-o’-wisps, rushlights, corpse
lanterns—whatever they’re called—such evil creatures
lead people to their doom. With a supreme effort of
will, you broke free from the alluring enchantment, and
you’ve resolved to never let the strange lights of remote
wildernesses claim you again.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Survival and the Wisp Lore skill. You
gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat with both swamp
terrain and subterranean bodies of water.
Cosmic Caravan Pantheon
As friends of Wrin Sivinxi, the heroes all know that
she follows a pantheon of deities collectively known
as the Cosmic Caravan. Any hero who wants to can
also follow this pantheon. The rules for following a
pantheon are set forth on page 92 of Pathfinder Lost
Omens Gods and Magic, and the details of the Cosmic
Caravan are as follows.

The Cosmic Caravan is known to astronomers and
astrologers alike as a collection of constellations in the
sky, said to travel forever in a circle around the star
Cynosure. The association of a diverse array of gods
and demigods thematically linked with the stars and
the spaces between is a relatively new faith that first
rose to prominence in western Avistan, particularly in
Varisia, Nidal, and Ravounel. The deities worshiped
by the faithful of the Cosmic Caravan include: Desna,
Groetus, and Sarenrae; the empyreal lords Ashava,
Black Butterfly, and Pulura; the elven god Ketephys;
and the outer god Yog-Sothoth. This faith has been
gaining ground particularly in Nidal, where the
worship of the night is overwhelmingly associated
with Zon-Kuthon, and a rising number of Cosmic
Caravan worshipers seek to oppose or, one day, even
overthrow the Midnight Lord’s theocracy to reclaim
the night from the implications that all who dwell in
the dark are evil.
Otari Gazetteer
Otari is a thriving, diverse lumber town and trade port
with a storied past and its fair share of sinister secrets.
Founded by a group of adventurers over 400 years
ago, the town has weathered attacks from kobolds
and strange monsters, economic woes and windfalls,
and cycles of prosperity and strife. Today, the town
is a prosperous community and one of the largest
settlements along the island’s southern coast.
Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two
looming cliffs. The Osprey River flows into the sea
through the middle of this valley, and the sturdy
stone to either side of this river supports hundreds
of buildings and a deep harbor. Otari rarely floods,
but the numerous caves, warrens, and channels dug
beneath the town do so regularly.
Though day-to-day life in Otari resembles that
in any small town, its skyline stands out due to the
enormous waterwheel at its eastern edge, the ingenious
and enormous flume that brings lumber down the
cliffside for easy transportation, and a stunning domedPLAYER'S GUIDEPLAYER'S GUIDE

temple to Sarenrae to the west. The town’s location
near a major highway and its long history as a home to
various adventuring parties draw many visitors. Lively
trade passing through means unusual wares (and even
magic items) aren’t too difficult to find.
Just over 1,200 people live in Otari. While most of its
residents are humans, some dwarves, elves, and other
ancestries also live here. The majority of its residents
work in the local fishing and lumber industries. For the
most part, people in Otari are friendly and welcoming,
though they prefer its small-town feel and make
lighthearted fun of visitors from big cities. Coffee is
a mainstay, a favorite drink among the hardworking
and early-rising townsfolk.
Oseph Menhemes, a descendant of one of Otari’s
founders, has served multiple terms as the town’s
elected mayor thanks to his easygoing efficiency and
the townspeople’s general deference to tradition. He
also runs one of the town’s main lumber companies,
making him wealthy as well as influential.
WHO’S WHO IN OTARI
In addition to the tiefling curio vendor and stargazer
Wrin Sivinxi, the heroes are likely to encounter some
of the following individuals during their adventures in
and around Otari.
Lardus Longsaddle
The Otari Guard keeps the peace in town, and
their leader is the gruff and stout Captain Lardus
Longsaddle. Any heroes who get in trouble with the
Otari Guard should hope to deal with anyone other
than the captain—his curse-laden tirades are legendary,
and he’s inclined to issue short jail sentences for minor
infractions. Conversely, heroes who catch criminals
earn a rare (though often short-lived) position on
Captain Longsaddle’s good side.
Oseph Menhemes
The current mayor of Otari is Oseph Menhemes,
patriarch of one of three local lumber companies and
owner of Otari’s massive Giant’s Wheel and Loading
Flume. Though dedicated to his role as a public
servant and a devoted family man with many children,
Oseph is ambitious and wants to expand the town’s
lumber-processing capacities.
Vandy Banderdash
The head priestess of Otari’s largest temple, the
Dawnflower Library, is a chatty woman named
Vandy Banderdash. Always eager to greet newcomers,
regardless of their faith or vocation, Vandy has a
surprising knack for recommending the perfect bit
of reading to people she has only just met. Though
open-minded on almost every subject, she has no
patience for thievery, as her sister stole several valuable
books from the temple and fled not long ago.
Yinyasmera
The shrewd Yinyasmera owns Crook’s Nook, making
her one of the town’s most prominent business owners.
The fact that she’s also the head of the Osprey Club,
Otari’s thieves’ guild, only increases her influence. She’s
loyal to her town and rarely permits her thieves to
target locals, although outsiders are fair targets for con
games or robberies. Heroes unafraid to step outside
the law eventually come to Yinyasmera’s attention.

GATHERING PLACES
Gathering places are at the heart of every settlement,
and Otari is no exception.
Crow’s Casks
A sign over the door to this two-story
stone building depicts a group of drunk
crows perched on a leaky cask. Crow’s
Casks is more than just a tavern—it’s a
brewery and a shrine to Cayden Cailean,
the god of heroes, bravery, and ale. Its
proprietor, Magiloy, is a retired
pirate who enjoys experimenting
with new drinks. She’s always
looking for enthusiastic
customers to taste her
latest concoctions.
Crook’s Nook
Crook’s Nook serves several purposes in
town—the large wooden structure functions
as a bridge over the Osprey River, as a cheap
place to get a room for the night, and as a tavern well
known for serving the best seafood in town.
Trapdoors in the tavern’s floor allow direct
access to the river below for fishing,
and foolhardy (or inebriated) patrons
sometimes wrestle over these openings
to determine who’s stronger and who’s
getting wet. The building’s attic serves
as the guildhall for Otari’s thieves’
guild, the Osprey Club—a function
that’s perhaps the town’s worst-kept
secret, as evidenced by the building’s
very name.
Otari Fishery
Every night, from an hour
before sundown to an
hour before midnight,
Tamily Tanderveil opens the
ground floor of the town’s main
fishery to sailors, laborers, and travelers
alike, offering a comfortable and welcoming
place to gather for games and entertainment.
A small menu is offered for those who wish to have
drinks or snacks while gaming here, the proceeds
of which Tamily frequently gives back in the form
of contests and prize money for various impromptu
gaming tournaments.
Otari Garrison
The headquarters of the Otari Guard is a sturdy stone
building hung with green-and-white banners
that match the guards’ uniforms. These
guards keep the peace in town and patrol
the surrounding roads to ensure they stay
free of banditry and trouble. They also
serve as the town’s firefighters.
Rowdy Rockfish
Despite its name, the Rowdy Rockfish
is the quietest and quaintest of Otari’s
taverns. A sign depicting a rockfish with
its fins up in a boxing pose hangs outside,
but within, the calm demeanor of the
tavern’s patrons might make someone
wonder if it’s the only tavern in the
Inner Sea to never host a barroom
brawl. The Rockfish’s current proprietor
is a dignified dwarf named Brelda
Venkervale, a stoic businesswoman who
took over the bar after her son, Lasda—the
previous owner—vanished without a trace. She still
seeks out information about her missing
son, certain that he still lives.
LANDMARKS
Whether approached by sea or by land,
Otari has several distinctive landmarks
that everyone in town knows. Even
newcomers to town soon learn to
orient themselves by these structures.
Dawnflower Library
Otari’s largest temple is built at the
town’s westernmost edge, atop an
upraised shelf that’s nevertheless
far below the clifftop. The
library’s position allows it to
catch the rays of the rising sun,
which transform its central
dome into a glowing testament
to the sun goddess Sarenrae—at
least when the sky is clear.
While principally dedicated to Sarenrae,
the Dawnflower Library welcomes all non-evil faiths.
The building’s two wings each contain shrines, and
the center houses a wide range of books, including
histories, satires, textbooks, and maps to innumerable
exciting locales.PLAYER'S GUIDEPLAYER'S GUIDE

The Giant’s Wheel
This towering waterwheel is truly a sight to
behold. With a diameter of 30 feet, the immense
wooden wheel generates the torque needed
to power a mechanized lumber mill and
turn a treadmill that transports cut
logs. The Giant’s Wheel has belonged
to the Menhemes family for
generations, but it isn’t exclusively
used by the Otari Mill. The other
two lumber companies pay to use the
waterwheel, allowing Oseph to keep
an eye on his competition. The constant
noise of the wheel’s grinding and
churning competes with the whine
of the saws and the clatter of
the loading ramp. At night,
the busywork of the mill can
be heard in the town below.
Day-to-day operation of the
Giant’s Wheel and its mill fall to its
foreman, the heavily scarred ex-gladiator
named Klorte Hengus. In his youth, Klorte made a
name for himself as a gladiator in a distant metropolis,
fighting with paired hatchets as “the Lumberjacker.”
The serious Klorte considers that violent past behind
him, and he fails to see any irony in the fact that he
now works for actual lumberjacks.
Lumber Flume
This long flume sends water diverted from the Osprey
River and timber from the Giant’s Wheel hundreds of
feet south to the harbor for easy loading onto ships.
The loading ramp has long been a draw to local youths
who enjoy “riding the chute” from the clifftop above
to the harbor below, but Klorte keeps a wary eye out
for such foolishness.
Stone Ring Pond
A total of two dozen standing stones, each exactly 12
feet high, stand like sentries around the shores of a
shallow pond. The site is usually occupied by polite
but aloof pilgrims of Desna (patron of travelers) or
of Gozreh (patron of nature). A kindly nature priest
named Worliwynn permanently resides there, and she
helps the loggers work harmoniously with nature.
GOODS AND SERVICES
Heroes need quality equipment for their adventures,
so your party might look to make some purchases
while they’re in Otari. The following shops can serve
as more than just places for heroes to spend their
hard-earned wealth; their proprietors are
interesting people who can aid the heroes
in other ways.
Blades for Glades
The primary smithy in town specializes
in crafting saws, axes, and other tools
used in the lumber trade, but the skilled
smiths here also produce quality armor,
shields, and weapons. The owner of Blades
for Glades is a misanthropic man named
Carman Rajani, who’s as happy to sell a
sword to split a monster as a hatchet to
fell a tree. He’s descended from one
of Otari’s founders and believes
himself entitled to better treatment
from the townspeople than his
surly demeanor earns him.
Crow’s Casks
This brewery’s proprietor, Magiloy, creates magical
potions in addition to delicious (but sometimes
questionable) beverages—your GM will have
information about what sorts of potions and
dubious drinks might be for sale during any one
visit. Magiloy might reserve special potions or good
deals for those who fetch rare ingredients for her
or for those who break up the tavern’s occasional
bar fights.
Dawnflower Library
Otari’s largest temple contains more than ordinary
books; the clerics also sell scrolls, wands, and magic
weapons. True to her reputation of being unusually
knowledgeable, the high priestess Vandy Banderdash
can often direct visitors to exactly the scroll or weapon
they need.
Gallentine Deliveries
Oloria Gallentine is a seventh-generation citizen of
Otari and the owner of the fastest and most reliable
delivery service in the area. Oloria can probably acquire
anything the heroes need that they can’t find in Otari,
although the price for such orders might be steep.
Odd Stories
The wizard Morlibint specializes in fanciful fiction,
but he and his husband also sell textbooks, teachingPLAYER'S GUIDEPLAYER'S GUIDE

tools, and scrolls. Morlibint is incredibly well-
read and can help the heroes decipher tomes in
ancient or unusual languages they might encounter
in their adventures. He eagerly purchases rare
books the heroes come across in their adventures,
hoping to resell them at a profit (after reading
them, of course).
Otari Market
Part open-air farmer’s market, part log-cabin trading
post, the Otari Market is a one-stop shop for basic
goods. Available wares include all adventuring gear,
light armor, and simple weapons. The market’s owner
is the dour, humorless Keeleno Lathenar. Keeleno pays
handsomely for wolf pelts, as a wolf-like monster slew
his wife years ago, and he hopes to one day acquire the
skin of her killer.
Wrin’s Wonders
This odd, domed building is always open. The
proprietor, Wrin Sivinxi, sells adventuring gear and
magic items. Wrin is a bit unusual, seeing menace in
every corner and truths in the constellations above,
but she’s eager to get to know adventurers and show
off the many magical trinkets in her collection.
DANGEROUS LOCALES
Even a town as small and comfortable as Otari has its
fair share of dangerous places nearby that many locals
know to avoid.
Gauntlight Keep
About a half hour’s walk north of Otari is a sprawling
swamp called Fogfen. Ruined Gauntlight Keep lies
within, overgrown with moss and overrun with
vermin. Over the last several generations, hopeful
explorers have poked around the ruins, but they’re
generally considered unsafe and wholly picked over
today. The most mysterious feature of Gauntlight Keep
is a lighthouse that towers above the ruins, curiously
far from the shore. The lighthouse hasn’t ever shone its
light in living memory, but there’s nevertheless a vague
unease about the structure in Otari—if its eerie light
shines, sinister things must be afoot.
Otari Graveyard
High on the cliff above the Dawnflower Library, the
Otari Graveyard holds crumbling mausoleums and
groves of leafless trees. Few enter this ancient cemetery
other than the acolytes who tend it, as it’s hard to
reach even though it looms over the town. Rumors of
undead roaming the cemetery at night persist among
Otari’s most superstitious townspeople.
Otari Hinterlands
The old hills and forests around Otari have been
inhabited since long before the town existed. Fallen
fortresses of would-be warlords, dank barrows
crawling with undead, and caves filled with monsters
and forgotten treasure are all rumored to lie within a
few hours’ walk of Otari.
THE ROSEGUARD
An adventuring party who made their name in
Absalom, the Roseguard defeated the villainous
Belcorra Haruvex and founded the logging town of
Otari. Today, the people of Otari continue to respect
and honor the Roseguard on Founder’s Day, 3 Desnus.
The Roseguard consisted of the following heroes.
Aesephna Menhemes: Aesephna was the party’s
healer. She was a cleric of Erastil who was always
more comfortable in smaller towns than big cities
like Absalom.
Otari Ilvashti: Otari, the group’s rogue, was a
charming optimist who kept the others hopeful
with his charm and humor, even during their
darkest hours.
Vol Rajani: Vol was the party’s fighter, a
no-nonsense swordswoman who claimed to be exiled
royalty from Nidal.
Zarmavdian: The group’s wizard was a
well-educated diviner who pursued outlandish
conspiracy theories and occult lore.PLAYER'S GUIDEPLAYER'S GUIDE
