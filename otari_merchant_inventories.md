## Notes for GM

**Haggling:** Players can attempt Diplomacy checks to reduce prices by 10% (DC 15) or 20% (DC 20).

**Reputation:** If players have helped Otari (completed quests, defeated threats), merchants may offer 10% discount.

**Wrin's Insight:** Wrin occasionally has prophetic visions and may warn players about upcoming dangers or hint at useful items.

**Keeleno's Quest:** If players bring him wolf pelts (especially from werewolves or dire wolves), he becomes more friendly and may offer better prices or information.

**Morlibint's Knowledge:** Can provide information on:
- Gauntlight history (Occultism DC 15)
- Ancient languages (Linguistics DC varies)
- Magical theory (Arcana DC 15)
- Local legends (Society DC 12)
