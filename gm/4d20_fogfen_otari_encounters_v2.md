**Stats:** HP: 85 | AC: 21 | Fort: 21 | Reflex: +15 | Will: +9

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Utterly evil spawn of Lamashtu, leucrottas are much more than they appear. While they may look like mere animalistic predators they are in fact as intelligent as the average human but use this intelligence only for creating sadistic new hunting techniques.

The leucrotta resembles a chimeric mix of animals with a badger-like head, the body of a lean predatory cat, and the feet of a stag. This odd mixture probably results from being the spawn of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. If legend is to be believed, leucrottas were created when Lamashtu took a particularly large, virile hyena as a mate. Leucrottas are about five feet tall and weigh around eight hundred pounds.12 Instead of teeth, a leucrotta possesses jagged bony ridges capable of shearing through steel.3

Leucrottas prefer to dwell in open areas where they can easily run down their prey. They often lair near rivers knowing that a nearby source of water is likely to draw prey.

Hags have been around for a very long time. Some sages speculate that they moved to Golarion from the First World. It has even been suggested that they may once have been fey, cursed for their vanity and turned into crones.10 The fey fable of the Three sisters of Simarron tells a similar story.15

Hag offspring, known as changelings, are typically born when a hag tricks a male of another species into coupling with her. The hag normally murders and eats the changeling's father before he can ever see his child. After giving birth, the hag then abandons the child with a family or organisation of the father's ancestry that she believes will care for the child, such as a temple.1617 Changelings can also be born when a hag coven performs ritual magic near a settlement, and such babies are often soon abandoned or orphaned.

### Title: THE ZOMBIE OWLBEAR

**Setup:** The path ahead is blocked.

**Read-Aloud:** *"You spot a Zombie Owlbear ahead, and it spots you."*

**Creature:** Zombie Owlbear (Level moderate, A dangerous Zombie Owlbear)

**Stats:** HP: 85 | AC: 16 | Fort: 16 | Reflex: +8 | Will: +5

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A zombie is the corpse of a creature animated by necromantic magic. These mindless undead are among the most common servants of necromancers and evil clerics, as they require relatively little magical power to create and maintain. Zombies retain the basic physical form of the creature they were in life, but their flesh is pallid and rotting, and they move with an awkward, shambling gait.

Unlike some undead that retain fragments of their former personality or intelligence, zombies are completely mindless automatons that follow simple commands from their creator. They feel no pain, fear, or hesitation, making them relentless opponents that continue attacking until destroyed or commanded to stop.

Zombies are often created in large numbers to serve as shock troops or laborers. Their main advantages are their resilience to damage and their complete obedience. However, their slow movement and lack of tactical thinking make them vulnerable to prepared opponents.

Kuribus are small child-like angels tasked with guarding sacred places.1

Kuribus look like halfling-sized, child-like, round-cheeked humanoids, and have flawless marble-like skin that is as tough as stone; as a result, all kuribus can blend in with the architecture of a church. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. It wields a bow and carries a quiver full of arrows on its back. A typical kuribu stands three feet tall and weighs 60 pounds.1

A kuribu has four true holy countenances, three of which are hidden at any time. Each countenance provides different benefits, and the kuribu can present a different countenance to gain its benefits in exchange of those of the countenance that just got hidden. The majority of kuribus can take on the countenances of eagles, lions and oxen, but a few variant kuribus possessing the aspects of different animals do exist.1

**Creature:** Rare, Undead (Level moderate, A dangerous Rare, Undead)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

**Creature:** Nymph (Level moderate, A dangerous Nymph)

**Stats:** HP: 46 | AC: 19 | Fort: 27 | Reflex: +15 | Will: +21

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Nymphs are fey who take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and watch over natural areas of splendour and beauty, which are always more scenic and pristine than normal. They often become subjects of art, but artists who seek to earn a nymph's favour should ensure that she is satisfied with the result, lest she feel insulted and lash out with magic.1

Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who watch over large, pristine areas of wilderness. Unlike regular nymphs, nymph queens are not dependent on their wards, and strengthen and vivify them when they are healthy, but cause them to become twisted when they are not physically or psychologically well. In addition to their regular appearance, which resembles a normal nymph of their kind, nymph queens can also take a more humanoid-looking form. A nymph queen can inspire an intelligent creature with a token of her favour, usually a lock of her hair.2

**Creature:** Undead Murder (Level moderate, A dangerous Undead Murder)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort: 18 | Reflex: +7 | Will: +13

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

# DIFFICULT ENCOUNTERS

## Roll: 65 (DIFFICULT)

### Title: THE ZOMBIE LORD

**Setup:** Danger approaches rapidly.

**Read-Aloud:** *"The Zombie Lord roars and charges!"*

**Creature:** Zombie Lord (Level difficult, A dangerous Zombie Lord)

**Stats:** HP: 80 | AC: 20 | Fort: 20 | Reflex: +11 | Will: +10

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A zombie is the corpse of a creature animated by necromantic magic. These mindless undead are among the most common servants of necromancers and evil clerics, as they require relatively little magical power to create and maintain. Zombies retain the basic physical form of the creature they were in life, but their flesh is pallid and rotting, and they move with an awkward, shambling gait.

Unlike some undead that retain fragments of their former personality or intelligence, zombies are completely mindless automatons that follow simple commands from their creator. They feel no pain, fear, or hesitation, making them relentless opponents that continue attacking until destroyed or commanded to stop.

Zombies are often created in large numbers to serve as shock troops or laborers. Their main advantages are their resilience to damage and their complete obedience. However, their slow movement and lack of tactical thinking make them vulnerable to prepared opponents.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A ghost is the spirit of a mortal creature whose soul cannot, or will not, leave a specific location in the Universe and travel on to the afterlife due to its tragic death or lack of closure.1

Ghost normally appear either as they did in life or as they did at the moment of their death, often becoming incorporeal copies of their former selves, including ghostly copies of their clothes and any items they carried.2citation needed

These restless spirits often haunt the site of their death to try to make right the untoward circumstances—real or perceived—of their death. If not where they died, ghosts can instead most often be found haunting somewhere that was deeply significant to them in life; where this is varies hugely from person to person, creature to creature.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Kushtaka,1 also called land otters, are a species of devious shapeshifter born when a humanoid joins a kushtaka village and has their soul slowly eroded away.2

A kushtaka resembles an anthropomorphic otter, but every individual can also shapeshift into a unique form that can be of any appropriately sized humanoid ancestry.2

Alongside their shapeshifting ability, every kushtaka can innately cast a limited number of occult spells. The transformation into a kushtaka removes the original creature's mortal soul, and as a result kushtaka are immune to haunts and cannot sense incorporeal undead, such as ghosts.2
