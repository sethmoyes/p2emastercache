Of the countless powerful demons who rule the various layers of the Outer Rifts, some are better and more widely known and worshiped. The most ubiquitous demon lord is the deity Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters.5

Abrikandilus are formed from the souls of vandals or defacers of works of art, especially those who did so out of envy. Their hatred of beauty is rivalled only by their loathing of their own shape, the sight of which (but not that of others of its kind) drives an abrikandilu into rage.1

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 20 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

**Creature:** Wight (Level moderate, A dangerous Wight)

**Stats:** HP: 50 | AC: 18 | Fort: 24 | Reflex: +13 | Will: +17

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Wights are undead creatures born from warriors who died in battle with a terrible rage or hatred burning in their hearts. This fury persists beyond death, animating their corpses and driving them to seek vengeance against the living. Unlike mindless undead, wights retain much of their combat prowess and tactical thinking from life, making them formidable opponents.

Wights appear as withered, desiccated humanoids with burning hatred visible in their eyes. Their touch drains the life force from living creatures, leaving victims weakened and vulnerable. Those slain by a wight often rise as wights themselves, forever bound to serve their killer.

These undead are often found haunting battlefields, ancient fortresses, or places where great violence occurred. They sometimes lead groups of lesser undead, using their retained intelligence to coordinate attacks against the living.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

Drakes are bestial relatives of primal dragons.12 Drakes share many traits with primal dragons, such as sturdy leathery wings, reptilian forms, dangerous breath, and the ability to speak, but they lack forearms and primal dragons' greater intelligence.34 A pack of drakes is called a rampage.41

Compared to dragons, drakes are smaller, physically weaker, and slower.1 They reach reproductive maturity earlier than dragons and are consequently more common. Drakes breed every five years, laying clutches of eggs that must be incubated for three to six weeks under specific conditions particular to each drake species. Drake hatchlings imprint on the first creature they see and reach maturity in two years.41

Drake eggs have little significant variance in coloration by species, requiring a trained eye to discern their differences.

### Title: THE MORLOCK

**Setup:** An unnatural presence fills the area.

**Creature:** Morlock (Level easy, A dangerous Morlock)

**Stats:** HP: 38 | AC: 17 | Fort: 21 | Reflex: +9 | Will: +11

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Morlocks are degenerate descendants of small, isolated human communities where inbreeding is common for prolonged periods.1

Despite their evolutionary regression, morlocks vaguely resemble the ancient human peoples from whom they devolved. They stand only a foot shorter than the average person, but due to their stooped, animal-like posture, they often appear much shorter. This is further accentuated by their habit of running on all fours. Morlock faces are very different from human faces: their eyes are huge, white and bulge from their heads, their mouths are wide and filled with flesh-tearing teeth, and their ears protrude from their skull like those of a cave bat. A morlock's body looks emaciated when compared to the average human's and their skin is the pale white of a creature that has not been exposed to the sun in millennia.2

Morlocks are expert climbers, having adapted to the terrain of their subterranean home in a way few other creatures have.

### Title: THE UNCOMMON, UNDEAD

**Setup:** Strange sounds echo ahead.

**Creature:** Uncommon, Undead (Level moderate, A dangerous Uncommon, Undead)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

### Title: THE KAPOACINTH

**Setup:** An unnatural presence fills the area.

**Read-Aloud:** *"A Kapoacinth blocks your path menacingly."*

**Creature:** Kapoacinth (Level difficult, A dangerous Kapoacinth)

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 20 | Fort: 20 | Reflex: +13 | Will: +9

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Resembling stony statues of winged monsters, gargoyles are airborne menaces in both civilised regions and remote wildernesses.2

Gargoyles resemble a stone statue of some hideous, malevolent creature. Most are humanoid with bat's wings, but individual gargoyles can take many forms, including those that do not resemble any known creature. They can remain so unnaturally still that they can pass as statues, and it takes a perceptive eye to distinguish them from normal, inanimate statues. A gargoyle's appearance very slowly shifts over time to adapt to its surroundings, which allows it to match the local architectural style13 or the surrounding stone of a wilderness region.4

The Ashwing gargoyles of the Cinderlands have smooth, wind-worn bodies with rippling ashen and brick-coloured patterns,45 while gargoyles of the Uwaga Highlands are chalky and pale to better resemble the Chalk Cliffs they call home.6

## Roll: 80 (DEADLY)

### Title: THE SHOCK ZOMBIE

**Setup:** A threatening shape emerges.

**Read-Aloud:** *"A Shock Zombie stalks toward you with hostile intent."*

**Creature:** Shock Zombie (Level deadly, A dangerous Shock Zombie)

**Stats:** HP: 140 | AC: 21 | Fort: 21 | Reflex: +14 | Will: +17

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A zombie is the corpse of a creature animated by necromantic magic. These mindless undead are among the most common servants of necromancers and evil clerics, as they require relatively little magical power to create and maintain. Zombies retain the basic physical form of the creature they were in life, but their flesh is pallid and rotting, and they move with an awkward, shambling gait.

Unlike some undead that retain fragments of their former personality or intelligence, zombies are completely mindless automatons that follow simple commands from their creator. They feel no pain, fear, or hesitation, making them relentless opponents that continue attacking until destroyed or commanded to stop.

Zombies are often created in large numbers to serve as shock troops or laborers. Their main advantages are their resilience to damage and their complete obedience. However, their slow movement and lack of tactical thinking make them vulnerable to prepared opponents.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Fishermen at the Otari Fishery have spotted these creatures from their boats. They avoid certain areas of Fogfen now.
