#### Lore Connection (Inner Sea Region):

Exposure to aberrations can drive mortals mad, as the mind struggles to comprehend forms and geometries that should not exist. Scholars who study such creatures often find their sanity eroding, their dreams filled with visions of impossible angles and colors that have no name.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Keeleno Lathenar at Otari Market pays extra for pelts or parts from dangerous creatures. This one would fetch a good price.
