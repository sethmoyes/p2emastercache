Despite their size, hadrosaurids likely flee from fights, rarely showing aggression, though a stampeding herd is incredibly dangerous and destructive.12

### Title: THE UNDEAD, UNIQUE

**Setup:** The path ahead is blocked.

**Read-Aloud:** *"A Undead, Unique emerges from the mist!"*

**Creature:** Undead, Unique (Level moderate, A dangerous Undead, Unique)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces.

For example, frost giants consume large amounts of snow with their meals, while shadow giants crave the Netherworld's tangible shadow matter.2

There are many forms of giant on Golarion broadly classifiable into two categories: true giants and giantkin.4 True giants are sometimes referred to as giantkind.5

Wasps are aggressive flying insects with a painful sting. They range in size from a fraction of an inch to several inches. Individual wasps are generally not dangerous to the average humanoid, but when they mass in huge wasp swarms of several thousand, they can become a serious hazard.2

The wasp is the sacred animal of Calistria: the goddess of lust, revenge, and trickery. Calistria's herald, the Menotherian, resembles a gigantic wasp with prehensile hands at the end of its forelegs.3 Sometimes followers of Calistria acquire a wasp as a familiar.4

**Stats:** HP: 50 | AC: 19 | Fort: 17 | Reflex: +11 | Will: +5

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Grothluts are the result of fleshwarping on human subjects.12 Most fleshwarpers consider them failures because of their diminished faculties; others, like many drow3 and cultists of Haagenti, consider this idiocy a strength and use them as perimeter guards due to the ease with which they can be controlled and herded.124

A grothlut's body is a white, formless, legless, hairless, slug-like mass with a vaguely humanoid upper body. In the fleshwarping process, their arms become rubbery and lack strength, drooping to their sides. Facial features smooth out—the nose sinks in, the cheeks widen and flatten, and the eyes become pale and seem to meld in with the surrounding skin.524

Grothluts lose most of their intellect, becoming practically mindless, and feel nothing but the pain of their transformation.

They stand only a foot shorter than the average person, but due to their stooped, animal-like posture, they often appear much shorter. This is further accentuated by their habit of running on all fours. Morlock faces are very different from human faces: their eyes are huge, white and bulge from their heads, their mouths are wide and filled with flesh-tearing teeth, and their ears protrude from their skull like those of a cave bat. A morlock's body looks emaciated when compared to the average human's and their skin is the pale white of a creature that has not been exposed to the sun in millennia.2

Morlocks are expert climbers, having adapted to the terrain of their subterranean home in a way few other creatures have.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A weremoose is a variety of werecreature that can shift between humanoid and moose forms.1

A weremoose can change between their forms at will, and they can expose others to the curse of the weremoose by striking them with their antlers. It can can communicate with mundane moose and other species of deer. As with all werecreatures, a weremoose is vulnerable to silver.2

Weremoose most often live as hunters or hermits; they tend towards stubbornness and surly attitudes. They do not hide or retreat if another enters their territory, but they are also unlikely to attack unless provoked.1

For example, frost giants consume large amounts of snow with their meals, while shadow giants crave the Netherworld's tangible shadow matter.2

There are many forms of giant on Golarion broadly classifiable into two categories: true giants and giantkin.4 True giants are sometimes referred to as giantkind.5

Unicorns often live near and protect wilderness areas unspoiled by civilization, or sacred locations.1 They are often solitary creatures, but a mated pair may be found together (they mate for life) and there have been reports of a "blessing" of up to six unicorns being encountered.3citation needed

Farmers try to attract these spirits by leaving offerings on the farmstead; such offerings may be of bread, wool, or shiny trinkets. New animals are introduced to the dvorovoi in order to gain its favor. Dvorovoi hate white animals, such as horses or cattle, but, oddly enough, not white chickens.2

Aurochs are large migrating herd mammals, standing over 7 feet tall at the shoulder, which are closely related to domesticated cattle.1 They resemble large, razor-horned bison.2

Aurochs travel in herds,1 following the grass that quickly crops up in these volatile climates.3 They travel in this way to protect each other, adult males forming a ring around those less able to defend themselves when threats arise.1 Aurochs are most often used by people as a source of meat, wool, and leather.4

There are various breeds, ranging from those found in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords to Belkzen's southern floodplains.564 Large herds of aurochs are also found on the Nesmian Plains of southern Nirmathas.7 An especially large and aggressive breed, the Storval aurochs, wanders through the Storval Plateau and the Cinderlands of Varisia.82

**Stats:** HP: 60 | AC: 21 | Fort: 21 | Reflex: +8 | Will: +11

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A peryton combines the body, forelegs, and antlers of a stag with the wings and hind legs of a giant bird of prey and the head of a monstrous wolf.1 Its shadow takes uncanny forms, including that of its humanoid victims.2

Most adult perytons measure four feet in length and four-and-a-half feet in height, and weigh between 240 and 380 pounds. Their wings typically stretch to a span of more than 11 feet.2

While bestial in appearance, perytons are comparably intelligent to humans and can speak Common tongues.1 Some also speak ancient Azlanti, which is sometimes mistaken for human-sounding gibberish. However, they mutually loathe each other and rarely cooperate enough to become an organized threat to others.2

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Barghests are sapient, canine, shapeshifting beasts with inherent primal powers who hunt challenging, intelligent prey.12

Being shapechangers, barghests can take on the form of a canine or humanoid, which they often use to hide in plain sight and return to their true form to frighten others.1

Barghests possess a keen intelligence easily equal to that of most humanoids, and possess innate primal powers that allow them to briefly create mist, light, and small illusions, become invisible, and teleport to a creature that flees from of their reach. However, barghests who instill fear through supernatural means find the artificial terror they create to be unfulfilling.

**Setup:** Danger approaches rapidly.

**Creature:** Rare, Undead, Unholy, Vampire (Level difficult, A dangerous Rare, Undead, Unholy, Vampire)

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 22 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 20 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

For example, frost giants consume large amounts of snow with their meals, while shadow giants crave the Netherworld's tangible shadow matter.2
