**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 22 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

# MODERATE ENCOUNTERS

## Roll: 20 (MODERATE)

### Title: THE ANKHRAV

**Setup:** Strange sounds echo ahead.

**Creature:** Ankhrav (Level moderate, A dangerous Ankhrav)

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 20 | Fort: 18 | Reflex: +12 | Will: +8

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Verminous dangers that roam the hinterlands of civilisation, ankhravs1—also known as ankhegs2—are burrowing arthropod menaces that prey on livestock and the farmers who guard them.1

At first glance, an ankhrav resembles a gigantic arthropod. The length of its nearly horse-sized body1 is covered in hard chitin from its clacking mandibles to the back of its abdomen, and it sports six legs. Unlike insects, however, an ankhrav has only one set of eyes and possesses a rudimentary intelligence similar to that of reptiles. Its oversized mandibles excrete a potent acid which it uses to dissolve its food. Larger species of ankhravs the size of elephants have been spotted in remote wilderness areas, particularly deserts, where they prey upon giant scorpions, camels, and other creatures native to that environment.3

Ankhravs tend to dwell on the outskirts of civilisation where they have a steady access to food.

**Creature:** Incorporeal, Spirit, Undead, Unique (Level moderate, A dangerous Incorporeal, Spirit, Undead, Unique)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

**Stats:** HP: 45 | AC: 19 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

There are several types of hag, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However, they also have many features in common.

Hags have been around for a very long time. Some sages speculate that they moved to Golarion from the First World. It has even been suggested that they may once have been fey, cursed for their vanity and turned into crones.10 The fey fable of the Three sisters of Simarron tells a similar story.15

Hag offspring, known as changelings, are typically born when a hag tricks a male of another species into coupling with her. The hag normally murders and eats the changeling's father before he can ever see his child. After giving birth, the hag then abandons the child with a family or organisation of the father's ancestry that she believes will care for the child, such as a temple.1617 Changelings can also be born when a hag coven performs ritual magic near a settlement, and such babies are often soon abandoned or orphaned.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Kuribus are small child-like angels tasked with guarding sacred places.1

Kuribus look like halfling-sized, child-like, round-cheeked humanoids, and have flawless marble-like skin that is as tough as stone; as a result, all kuribus can blend in with the architecture of a church. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. It wields a bow and carries a quiver full of arrows on its back. A typical kuribu stands three feet tall and weighs 60 pounds.1

A kuribu has four true holy countenances, three of which are hidden at any time. Each countenance provides different benefits, and the kuribu can present a different countenance to gain its benefits in exchange of those of the countenance that just got hidden. The majority of kuribus can take on the countenances of eagles, lions and oxen, but a few variant kuribus possessing the aspects of different animals do exist.1

### Title: THE RARE, UNDEAD

**Creature:** Rare, Undead (Level moderate, A dangerous Rare, Undead)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

Giants are a grouping of many types of unusually large humanoids who live in Golarion's remote reaches.12

All giants share massive humanoid forms. They often range from 12 to 40 feet tall and measure their weight in tons.3 They also share an elemental hunger, the nature of which often corresponds to their own. For example, frost giants consume large amounts of snow with their meals, while shadow giants crave the Netherworld's tangible shadow matter.2

There are many forms of giant on Golarion broadly classifiable into two categories: true giants and giantkin.4 True giants are sometimes referred to as giantkind.5

Being shapechangers, barghests can take on the form of a canine or humanoid, which they often use to hide in plain sight and return to their true form to frighten others.1

Barghests possess a keen intelligence easily equal to that of most humanoids, and possess innate primal powers that allow them to briefly create mist, light, and small illusions, become invisible, and teleport to a creature that flees from of their reach. However, barghests who instill fear through supernatural means find the artificial terror they create to be unfulfilling.

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 20 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Undead creatures are tragically common in the Inner Sea region, particularly near sites of ancient battles, mass graves, or places touched by necromantic magic.

Gauntlight itself was built by the necromancer Belcorra Haruvex, whose dark magic still animates the dead centuries after her defeat.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Kodama,1 also known as tree kami, are a type of kami who protect wild trees of the forest.2

A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with no face, save for two hollow eyes, on its hemispherical head. It is three feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. If a tree is particularly ancient or immense, the kodama associated with it is much larger.2

A kodama takes a single tree as its ward; typically, all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area. Some kodama become druids; a rare few with unusually ordered minds become monks. When a kodama must fight, it is quick to move and enlist allies.2

Manticores are monstrous winged predators that combine the features of several creatures into a deadly whole.1

A manticore has the body of an immense lion the size of a horse, the wings of a dragon, and a long tail ending in a cluster of vicious porcupine-like quills.1 Some manticores have a lion's head, but others have the face of a snarling bearded human with razor-sharp teeth. Unlike lions or humans, both male and female manticores have manes or beards.2citation needed

It is unknown how manticores came into existence, though magic is assumed to be involved. Manticores are not picky eaters; they are ravenous eaters of meat, whether freshly killed or rotting carrion. They patrol vast stretches of land seeking food.2citation needed

## Roll: 80 (DEADLY)

### Title: THE SHOCK ZOMBIE

**Setup:** A threatening shape emerges.

**Read-Aloud:** *"A Shock Zombie stalks toward you with hostile intent."*

**Creature:** Shock Zombie (Level deadly, A dangerous Shock Zombie)

**Stats:** HP: 140 | AC: 21 | Fort: 21 | Reflex: +14 | Will: +17

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A zombie is the corpse of a creature animated by necromantic magic. These mindless undead are among the most common servants of necromancers and evil clerics, as they require relatively little magical power to create and maintain. Zombies retain the basic physical form of the creature they were in life, but their flesh is pallid and rotting, and they move with an awkward, shambling gait.

Unlike some undead that retain fragments of their former personality or intelligence, zombies are completely mindless automatons that follow simple commands from their creator. They feel no pain, fear, or hesitation, making them relentless opponents that continue attacking until destroyed or commanded to stop.

Zombies are often created in large numbers to serve as shock troops or laborers. Their main advantages are their resilience to damage and their complete obedience. However, their slow movement and lack of tactical thinking make them vulnerable to prepared opponents.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Jorsk Hinterclaw at Blades for Glades has repaired armor damaged by creatures like this. He knows their attack patterns.
