#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Weresharks are werecreatures most common in the warm waters of the Shackles.1

Weresharks believe that sharks have the right to rule over the sea, believe that they deserve magic items due to this right, and often recruit sharks to enforce their will within their oceanic dominions. A few weresharks rise to the leadership of island settlements. Some are bloody tyrants who sow fear among their subjects, while others are fair, distant overlords; regardless, most weresharks are single-minded and do not tolerate questioning. Weresharks prefer to give space to others of their kind and rarely fight, but when they do, the ensuing battle often leaves both scarred or dead.

**Creature:** Amphibious, Undead (Level moderate, A dangerous Amphibious, Undead)

**Stats:** HP: 32 | AC: 18 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Otari's townsfolk whisper of disappearances near Fogfen. The Lumber Consortium has lost three workers this month to creatures like this.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead creatures are tragically common in the Inner Sea region, particularly near sites of ancient battles, mass graves, or places touched by necromantic magic. The goddess Urgathoa is patron of undead and disease, while Pharasma opposes all undead as abominations against the natural cycle. Gauntlight itself was built by the necromancer Belcorra Haruvex, whose dark magic still animates the dead centuries after her defeat.

### Title: THE ZOMBIE BEAR

**Creature:** Zombie Bear (Level moderate, A dangerous Zombie Bear)

**Stats:** HP: 75 | AC: 17 | Fort: 17 | Reflex: +8 | Will: +5

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A zombie is the corpse of a creature animated by necromantic magic. These mindless undead are among the most common servants of necromancers and evil clerics, as they require relatively little magical power to create and maintain. Zombies retain the basic physical form of the creature they were in life, but their flesh is pallid and rotting, and they move with an awkward, shambling gait.

Unlike some undead that retain fragments of their former personality or intelligence, zombies are completely mindless automatons that follow simple commands from their creator. They feel no pain, fear, or hesitation, making them relentless opponents that continue attacking until destroyed or commanded to stop.

Zombies are often created in large numbers to serve as shock troops or laborers. Their main advantages are their resilience to damage and their complete obedience. However, their slow movement and lack of tactical thinking make them vulnerable to prepared opponents.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

The town guard warns travelers about these threats. Captain Longsaddle maintains a bestiary of local dangers at the garrison.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Ocluais are fey gorgas who embody the fears of being lost in the dark and of terror lacking reason.1

An ocluai resembles a featherless owl with a serrated beak and the legs of a monkey. Like all gorgas, they have large hollow eyes composed of magic shadow.1

Like all gorgas, ocluais can see in all types of darkness, including magical darkness. Their shadowy forms interfere with the senses of nearby creatures, particularly their sense of location, and dims mundane sight sources to the point of ineffectiveness.1

**Stats:** HP: 45 | AC: 18 | Fort: 18 | Reflex: +6 | Will: +13

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

The Spring-Heeled Jack is a mysterious species of fey native to the First World who occasionally travels to the Universe to go on murder sprees. Due to their rarity and distrust of each other's company, Spring-Heeled Jacks have never been seen together, giving rise to the misconception that Spring-Heeled Jack is a singular, unique individual.12

Spring-Heeled Jacks are hairy, horned bipeds with cruel glowing eyes, cloven hooves, and a pointed tail. They tend to wear tattered cloaks, called Jack's Tattered Capes, to disguise themselves at night. While these disguises are crude, a Spring-Heeled Jack only needs his victim to let their guard down enough to move within striking distance (much further away than most victims realise). The species' name comes from a Spring-Heeled Jack's ability to instantly leap great distances, suddenly closing gaps to strike with a knife which he calls his "Little Love".2 A Spring-Heeled Jack is about 4 feet in height and 80 pounds in weight.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Werewolves are one of the two most common forms of werecreature (the other is the wererat) and one of the most feared.1 They are also referred to as lycanthropes, a term that when used correctly applies only to werewolves but is sometimes misused to refer generically to werecreatures.2

Werewolves hunt in a similar manner to wolves, seeking out the weakest prey and wearing it down. Thus they prefer to target lone travellers and isolated dwellings and avoid large groups and heavily settled areas. They usually live together in extended family units known as packs. A pack will usually claim an area as its territory, and travel around within it. In humanoid form the pack might appear to be a gypsy caravan, a troupe of travelling entertainers, or even a party of adventurers. They sometimes seek to deliberately inflict lycanthropy on others and recruit them into the pack.

Occasionally several packs will inhabit the same general area.

### Title: THE MORLOCK THRALL

**Setup:** A threatening shape emerges.

**Creature:** Morlock Thrall (Level difficult, A dangerous Morlock Thrall)

**Stats:** HP: 70 | AC: 20 | Fort: 20 | Reflex: +13 | Will: +8

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Morlocks are degenerate descendants of small, isolated human communities where inbreeding is common for prolonged periods.1

Despite their evolutionary regression, morlocks vaguely resemble the ancient human peoples from whom they devolved. They stand only a foot shorter than the average person, but due to their stooped, animal-like posture, they often appear much shorter. This is further accentuated by their habit of running on all fours. Morlock faces are very different from human faces: their eyes are huge, white and bulge from their heads, their mouths are wide and filled with flesh-tearing teeth, and their ears protrude from their skull like those of a cave bat. A morlock's body looks emaciated when compared to the average human's and their skin is the pale white of a creature that has not been exposed to the sun in millennia.2

Morlocks are expert climbers, having adapted to the terrain of their subterranean home in a way few other creatures have.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

The town guard warns travelers about these threats. Captain Longsaddle maintains a bestiary of local dangers at the garrison.

### Title: THE RARE, UNDEAD, UNHOLY, VAMPIRE

**Setup:** Danger approaches rapidly.

**Read-Aloud:** *"From the shadows, a Rare, Undead, Unholy, Vampire attacks!"*

**Creature:** Rare, Undead, Unholy, Vampire (Level difficult, A dangerous Rare, Undead, Unholy, Vampire)

**Stats:** HP: 40 | AC: 22 | Fort:  | Reflex:  | Will: 

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Undead1 are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly void energy or unholy magic that corrupted a recently departed soul.23 Undead can be either mindless or intelligent. Undead may be colloquially referred to as the walking dead.4

Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region (with Geb being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and soul.6

A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a humanoid skeleton can cost as little as 45 gold pieces. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering arcane necromancers rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of evil deities, or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.6

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Jorsk Hinterclaw at Blades for Glades has repaired armor damaged by creatures like this. He knows their attack patterns.

### Title: THE CAIRN WIGHT

**Setup:** You sense hostile intent nearby.

**Read-Aloud:** *"A Cairn Wight rises before you, ready for battle."*

**Creature:** Cairn Wight (Level difficult, A dangerous Cairn Wight)

**Stats:** HP: 67 | AC: 20 | Fort: 20 | Reflex: +12 | Will: +10

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Wights are undead creatures born from warriors who died in battle with a terrible rage or hatred burning in their hearts. This fury persists beyond death, animating their corpses and driving them to seek vengeance against the living. Unlike mindless undead, wights retain much of their combat prowess and tactical thinking from life, making them formidable opponents.

Wights appear as withered, desiccated humanoids with burning hatred visible in their eyes. Their touch drains the life force from living creatures, leaving victims weakened and vulnerable. Those slain by a wight often rise as wights themselves, forever bound to serve their killer.

These undead are often found haunting battlefields, ancient fortresses, or places where great violence occurred. They sometimes lead groups of lesser undead, using their retained intelligence to coordinate attacks against the living.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Morlibint at Odd Stories has ancient texts describing these creatures. He'll pay well for firsthand accounts.

## Roll: 78 (DEADLY)

### Title: THE CYCLOPS ZOMBIE

**Setup:** Danger approaches rapidly.

**Read-Aloud:** *"You spot a Cyclops Zombie ahead, and it spots you."*

**Creature:** Cyclops Zombie (Level deadly, A dangerous Cyclops Zombie)

**Stats:** HP: 160 | AC: 21 | Fort: 21 | Reflex: +16 | Will: +9

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

A zombie is the corpse of a creature animated by necromantic magic. These mindless undead are among the most common servants of necromancers and evil clerics, as they require relatively little magical power to create and maintain. Zombies retain the basic physical form of the creature they were in life, but their flesh is pallid and rotting, and they move with an awkward, shambling gait.

Unlike some undead that retain fragments of their former personality or intelligence, zombies are completely mindless automatons that follow simple commands from their creator. They feel no pain, fear, or hesitation, making them relentless opponents that continue attacking until destroyed or commanded to stop.

Zombies are often created in large numbers to serve as shock troops or laborers. Their main advantages are their resilience to damage and their complete obedience. However, their slow movement and lack of tactical thinking make them vulnerable to prepared opponents.

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

This creature was likely drawn from the depths of Gauntlight by Belcorra Haruvex's ancient magic, still pulsing after centuries.
