#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Wights are undead creatures born from warriors who died in battle with a terrible rage or hatred burning in their hearts. This fury persists beyond death, animating their corpses and driving them to seek vengeance against the living. Unlike mindless undead, wights retain much of their combat prowess and tactical thinking from life, making them formidable opponents.

Wights appear as withered, desiccated humanoids with burning hatred visible in their eyes. Their touch drains the life force from living creatures, leaving victims weakened and vulnerable. Those slain by a wight often rise as wights themselves, forever bound to serve their killer.

These undead are often found haunting battlefields, ancient fortresses, or places where great violence occurred. They sometimes lead groups of lesser undead, using their retained intelligence to coordinate attacks against the living.

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Abrikandilus are also known as wrecker demons, so called because of their constant need to destroy anything of beauty.1

An abrikandilu is a deformed, horned, hunchbacked humanoid with a forked rat tail and two thumbs per hand. It stands four feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.1

Abrikandilus are formed from the souls of vandals or defacers of works of art, especially those who did so out of envy. Their hatred of beauty is rivalled only by their loathing of their own shape, the sight of which (but not that of others of its kind) drives an abrikandilu into rage.1

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

The otyugh is a weird-looking scavenger,1 sometimes called a trash eater or a sewer beast.2

The otyugh has a bizarre anatomy: its large central body is mostly mouth, with three stumpy legs and three tentacles—two with barbs, and one with numerous eyes.1

Their origin is unknown, but they are believed to be natural creatures rather than the result of a magical experiment. One theory is that they may be related to crocodiles. They can be found in both swamps and sewers; presumably they originated in swamps, but later discovered sewers to be a great source of food. They live on garbage in sewers, or on rotting plants and animals in the swamp. Few creatures can stomach eating an otyugh, so numbers are usually determined by the amount of food available.3

#### Otari Connection (Players Guide):

Hadrosaurid, or duck-billed dinosaur, is a grouping of herbivorous dinosaur species that all share a characteristic flat snout with vegetation-grinding teeth. Their jaw shape is described as "duck-billed". Hadrosaurids can grow to the size of an elephant and usually range from 20 to 30 feet long with a maximum weight of about 10,000 pounds.12

Despite their size, hadrosaurids likely flee from fights, rarely showing aggression, though a stampeding herd is incredibly dangerous and destructive.12

Giants and other large creatures domesticate hadrosaurids but only as farmed livestock, as their propensity to run from danger makes them very poor mounts.12

**Stats:** HP: 45 | AC: 18 | Fort: 18 | Reflex: +6 | Will: +13

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

The Spring-Heeled Jack is a mysterious species of fey native to the First World who occasionally travels to the Universe to go on murder sprees. Due to their rarity and distrust of each other's company, Spring-Heeled Jacks have never been seen together, giving rise to the misconception that Spring-Heeled Jack is a singular, unique individual.12

Spring-Heeled Jacks are hairy, horned bipeds with cruel glowing eyes, cloven hooves, and a pointed tail. They tend to wear tattered cloaks, called Jack's Tattered Capes, to disguise themselves at night. While these disguises are crude, a Spring-Heeled Jack only needs his victim to let their guard down enough to move within striking distance (much further away than most victims realise). The species' name comes from a Spring-Heeled Jack's ability to instantly leap great distances, suddenly closing gaps to strike with a knife which he calls his "Little Love".2 A Spring-Heeled Jack is about 4 feet in height and 80 pounds in weight.

The starving meokdan, or hungry nindoru, is the least variety of nindoru.1

A meokdan appears human in shape, with thick hair that grows all over its head and leaves only its mouth visible. Its arms appear unnaturally long and broken, with long-fingered hands that have ragged nails. Its skin is covered in small, open sores.1

A meokdan can reach down its own throat and pull a bone from its stomach to wield as a fragile yet effective club. It can also gnaw on creatures or objects in an attempt to sate its hunger, using the frustration of attempting to eat an inanimate object to empower itself. Creatures killed by a meokdan are difficult to resurrect or raise as an undead creature, with the difficulty lingering until the offending meokdan is themself slain. Meokdans have a limited number of innate occult spells that they can cast, and they are able to speak in Aklo, Common, and Necril.1

#### Creature Lore (PathfinderWiki):

Bogeymen are terrifying fey who devour innocence and steal souls. Depending on their relative power and size, they are classified as bogeys, bugaboos, or bogeymen.1

Bogeymen methodically stalk and torment a single person at a time, usually a young child or elder, for days or even weeks at a time. Bogeys typically hide under a bed, in a dark attic, or in a slightly ajar closet, while the more sophisticated bogeymen might ominously appear in shadowy back alleys or street corners. From there, they hint at their presence to methodically cultivate the victims' realisation that they are not alone, before fully revealing themselves. Devouring three souls in a year causes a bogey to transform into a bugaboo; six souls are needed for a bugaboo to become a bogeyman.12

Sometimes, instead of killing his victim, a bogeyman might kidnap them and bring them to a far-off location.

Aghashes are a div species whose obsessive hatred concerns beautiful mortals.1citation needed

Merely watching an aghash opens one to the curse of the evil eye which it embodies. It can deliver curses from a distance, leading some victims to believe they have been afflicted by a disease or cursed by the gods, all while the aghash delights in the suffering it has caused.1citation needed
