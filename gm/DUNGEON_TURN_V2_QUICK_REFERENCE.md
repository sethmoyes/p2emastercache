# Dungeon Turn V2 - Quick Reference Guide

## The Problem We're Solving
Players are exhausted, paranoid, and bored. They only use Detect Magic and Listen at doors. The dungeon feels like a tedious grind: detect, search, fight, repeat.

## The Solution
**Time pressure + Meaningful choices + Living dungeon = FUN**

---

## How It Works

### The Dice Jar
1. Every 10-minute exploration activity adds **1 die** to the jar
2. At **5 dice**, roll all 5d20 and sum them
3. Look up the sum (5-100) in the encounter table for your current floor
4. Run the encounter
5. Empty the jar and start over

### What Adds Dice?
- Searching a room thoroughly (10 min)
- Treating wounds (10 min)
- Picking a complex lock (10 min)
- Studying inscriptions (10 min)
- Setting up traps (10 min)
- Any activity that takes ~10 minutes

### What Doesn't Add Dice?
- Quick actions (1-3 actions)
- Combat (separate time tracking)
- Moving through rooms quickly
- Brief conversations

## The New Probability Distribution

| Sum Range | Category | % | What It Does |
|-----------|----------|---|--------------|
| 5-25 | **OPPORTUNITIES** | 22% | Rewards creativity - shortcuts, intel, resources |
| 26-45 | **COMPLICATIONS** | 21% | Forces skill use - locked doors, puzzles, hazards |
| 46-65 | **DILEMMAS** | 21% | Meaningful choices - time vs safety, risk vs reward |
| 66-85 | **ACTIVE THREATS** | 21% | Immediate danger - patrols, alarms, collapsing floors |
| 86-100 | **COMBAT** | 16% | Actual fights with dungeon ecology |

**Combat Potential:** ~37% (ACTIVE THREATS can escalate to combat based on player choices)

## Running Each Category

### OPPORTUNITIES (5-25)
**Goal:** Make players feel smart for using skills

**How to Run:**
1. Present the opportunity clearly
2. Tell them what skills could help
3. Reward success generously
4. Don't punish failure harshly (just no reward)

**Examples:**
- Secret passages (save time)
- Eavesdropping (gain intel)
- Abandoned supplies (free healing)
- Friendly NPCs (information)
- Environmental advantages (tactical prep)

**Key:** These should feel like WINS, not traps

### COMPLICATIONS (26-45)
**Goal:** Force players to use skills they're ignoring

**How to Run:**
1. Present a problem that blocks progress
2. Offer multiple skill-based solutions
3. Make failure have consequences (but not death)
4. Reward creative approaches

**Examples:**
- Locked doors (Thievery or Athletics)
- Unstable floors (Acrobatics or Crafting)
- Magical wards (Arcana or Thievery)
- Language barriers (Society or Diplomacy)
- Poisoned air (Nature or Medicine)

**Key:** Can't just walk past - must engage

### DILEMMAS (46-65)
**Goal:** Create meaningful choices with trade-offs

**How to Run:**
1. Present 2-3 clear options
2. Each option has pros and cons
3. No "obviously correct" choice
4. Track their decision for later consequences

**Examples:**
- Loud path (fast) vs Quiet path (slow)
- Help prisoner (time cost) vs Ignore (guilt)
- Fight now (fresh) vs Avoid (harder later)
- Rest here (risky) vs Push on (exhausted)
- Loot now (time) vs Mark for later (might be gone)

**Key:** Every choice matters, no perfect solution

### ACTIVE THREATS (66-85)
**Goal:** Create urgency and immediate danger

**How to Run:**
1. Announce threat dramatically
2. Demand IMMEDIATE action (no time to discuss)
3. Make consequences clear and immediate
4. Reward quick thinking

**Examples:**
- "Patrol approaching! You have 1 round to hide!"
- "Floor collapsing! Reflex save NOW!"
- "Alarm ringing! Disable it or flee!"
- "Fire spreading! Move or burn!"
- "Ambush from above! Perception check!"

**Key:** No time to plan - react or suffer

### COMBAT (86-100)
**Goal:** Show dungeon ecology, drain resources

**How to Run:**
1. Describe what the creatures are DOING (not just "you see enemies")
2. Offer tactical options (sneak past, ambush, negotiate)
3. Make it clear this is avoidable if they're clever
4. Show monsters as living creatures, not just combat encounters

**Examples:**
- Ghouls feasting (distracted, surprise available)
- Morlocks vs Ghouls fighting (wait or join)
- Creatures sleeping (sneak past or ambush)
- Patrol on rounds (hide or prepare)
- Monsters working (distracted by tasks)

**Key:** Combat is ONE option, not the only option

## GM Tips

### Creating Tension
- **Describe the dice jar filling:** "That's 10 minutes. Add another die. You're at 4 now..."
- **Build anticipation:** "You're at 5 dice. Time to roll..."
- **Make rolls dramatic:** Roll in the open, let them see the dice
- **Track consequences:** If they trigger an alarm, ALL future encounters are harder

### Rewarding Creativity
- **Say yes to clever ideas:** If they think of something cool, let it work
- **Spotlight different players:** Rotate who gets to shine
- **Reward non-combat solutions:** Avoiding a fight is a WIN, not cowardice
- **Give information freely:** If they use the right skill, tell them useful stuff

### Keeping It Fun
- **Don't bog down:** If a complication is taking too long, move on
- **Don't TPK:** These encounters drain resources, not lives
- **Don't punish exploration:** Opportunities should feel rewarding
- **Don't make it tedious:** If players are having fun, don't interrupt with dice jar

### Tracking Consequences
Keep simple notes:
- "Alarm triggered - all encounters alerted"
- "Freed prisoner - might help later"
- "Scared off mitflits - they'll return with reinforcements"
- "Made noise - next encounter gets surprise round"

## Party Composition Spotlight

Your party:
- **Cleric:** Religion, Medicine, Diplomacy
- **Wizard:** Arcana, Recall Knowledge, Society
- **Rogue:** Thievery, Stealth, Acrobatics, Deception
- **Swashbuckler:** Acrobatics, Deception, Performance, Intimidation
- **Monk:** Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception

### Skills They're NOT Using (Priority to Reward):
- Acrobatics
- Athletics
- Crafting
- Deception
- Diplomacy
- Intimidation
- Nature
- Performance
- Society
- Survival

### Skills They're OVERUSING:
- Arcana (Detect Magic spam)
- Perception (Listen at every door)

**Strategy:** Create events that reward the unused skills!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Players are still just detecting magic everywhere"
- Make Opportunities that reward OTHER skills more
- Have enemies use magic constantly (so Detect Magic is always positive, giving no info)
- Create time pressure (detecting takes time, adds dice)

### "Players are avoiding all combat"
- That's GOOD! They're being smart!
- Combat encounters drain resources even if avoided (time, spells for stealth, etc.)
- Some Active Threats force combat regardless

### "The dice jar is filling too fast"
- Reduce what adds dice (only major activities)
- Increase jar size to 6 or 7 dice
- Make Opportunities more common (reward exploration)

### "The dice jar never fills"
- They're rushing! That's a choice.
- Remind them: "You could search this room thoroughly (10 min, add die) or move on quickly"
- Make Complications that force time expenditure

### "Players are frustrated by bad rolls"
- Opportunities should never punish failure harshly
- Complications should have multiple solutions
- Dilemmas should have no "wrong" choice
- Active Threats should be survivable with quick thinking

## Success Metrics

**You know it's working when:**
- Players use skills besides Detect Magic and Listen
- Players debate choices (Dilemmas working)
- Players feel time pressure (dice jar matters)
- Players engage creatively (Opportunities rewarding)
- Combat is ~50% of encounters (not 90%)
- Dungeon feels alive (monsters have lives)
- Players are having FUN (not tedious)

**Red flags:**
- Players only use 2-3 skills
- Players always choose same option
- Players ignore dice jar
- Every encounter is combat
- Players are bored or frustrated

---

## Quick Start

1. **Explain the system:** "Every 10 minutes adds a die. At 5 dice, we roll."
2. **Start the jar:** "You enter the dungeon. The jar is empty."
3. **Track time:** "Searching this room takes 10 minutes. Add a die."
4. **Roll at 5:** "You're at 5 dice. Let's see what happens..."
5. **Run the encounter:** Use the table for your current floor
6. **Empty and repeat:** "Jar is empty. Keep exploring."

## Remember

**The goal is FUN, not punishment.**

- Reward creativity
- Create tension
- Show living dungeon
- Drain resources (not lives)
- Make every choice matter

**If players are having fun, you're doing it right!**
