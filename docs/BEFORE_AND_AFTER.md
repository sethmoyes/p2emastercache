# Dungeon Turn System: Before and After

## The Problem

Your players were experiencing **dungeon fatigue**:
- Only using Detect Magic and Listen at doors
- Closing doors on monsters and walking away
- No time pressure or urgency
- Tedious pattern: detect, search, fight, repeat
- Exhausted and paranoid, not having fun

## The Old System (V1)

### Probability Distribution
- **5-35:** Beneficial/Very Minor (~10%)
- **36-52:** Flavor Events - Low (~20%)
- **53-69:** Flavor Events - High (~20%)
- **70-100:** Hazards/Encounters (~50%)

### Problems
1. **Too much combat** - 50% of encounters were fights
2. **Passive flavor** - Events were atmospheric but didn't demand action
3. **No meaningful choices** - Just descriptions, no decisions
4. **No skill rewards** - Didn't encourage using diverse skills
5. **No dungeon ecology** - Monsters just waiting to fight

### Example Old Event (Sum 42 - Flavor)
```
## Sum: 42 - Flavor Event

### Quill Scratching

**Description:** You hear a quill scratching on parchment from somewhere nearby. 
Constant. Methodical. Never stopping.

**What This Teaches:** Hints at endless work
```

**Result:** Atmospheric but passive. Players just nod and move on.

## The New System (V2)

### Probability Distribution
- **5-25:** OPPORTUNITIES (~22%) - Reward creativity
- **26-45:** COMPLICATIONS (~21%) - Force skill use
- **46-65:** DILEMMAS (~21%) - Meaningful choices
- **66-85:** ACTIVE THREATS (~21%) - Immediate danger
- **86-100:** COMBAT (~16%) - Living dungeon ecology

**Combat Potential:** ~37% (ACTIVE THREATS can escalate)

### Solutions
1. **50/50 combat split** - More variety, less grind
2. **Active engagement** - Every event demands action or choice
3. **Meaningful decisions** - Trade-offs with real consequences
4. **Skill spotlight** - Rewards using ALL Pathfinder 2e actions
5. **Living dungeon** - Monsters eat, sleep, fight each other

### Example New Events

#### OPPORTUNITY (Sum 7)
```
## Sum: 7 - OPPORTUNITY

### Fresh Tracks

**Description:** You find fresh tracks in the dust - multiple creatures 
passed through here recently.

**Challenge:** DC 17 Survival to identify creatures and direction
**Success:** You identify the creatures and know they went ahead. 
You can avoid or ambush them.
**Failure:** Tracks are too muddled to read clearly.
**Spotlight:** Rogue, Monk
**Skills:** Survival
**Time Cost:** 1 action to examine
**Reward:** Tactical choice, surprise advantage

**GM Notes:** If successful, next encounter can be avoided or players 
get surprise round.
```

**Result:** Rewards Survival skill (underused), gives tactical advantage, 
creates meaningful choice.

#### COMPLICATION (Sum 32)
```
## Sum: 32 - COMPLICATION

### Locked Iron Door

**Description:** A heavy iron door blocks the passage. The lock is 
complex but functional.

**Challenge:** DC 18 Thievery to pick lock OR DC 22 Athletics to force open
**Success:** Door opens. Quietly if picked, loudly if forced.
**Failure:** Lock jams (Thievery) or door holds (Athletics). Must find 
key or try different approach.
**Spotlight:** Rogue, Monk
**Skills:** Thievery, Athletics
**Time Cost:** 2 actions (Thievery) or 3 actions (Athletics)

**GM Notes:** If forced open, next encounter has surprise round against 
party (noise alert).
```

**Result:** Forces skill use, offers multiple solutions, has consequences 
for choices.

#### DILEMMA (Sum 52)
```
## Sum: 52 - DILEMMA

### Two Paths: Loud vs Quiet

**Description:** The passage splits. Left: a wide, clear corridor 
(fast but exposed). Right: narrow maintenance tunnels (slow but hidden).

**Choice A:** Take the loud path: 10 minutes, but next encounter is 
alerted to your presence
**Choice B:** Take the quiet path: 30 minutes (add 2 dice to jar), 
but next encounter doesn't know you're coming
**Spotlight:** All
**Skills:** Tactical thinking
**Time Cost:** 10 min vs 30 min

**GM Notes:** Track choice. Loud path = enemies get surprise round. 
Quiet path = party gets surprise round.
```

**Result:** Meaningful choice with clear trade-offs. Time vs stealth. 
No "right" answer.

#### ACTIVE THREAT (Sum 72)
```
## Sum: 72 - ACTIVE THREAT

### Patrol Approaching!

**Description:** You hear heavy footsteps and voices. A patrol is 
coming this way. You have seconds to act!

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED! No time to discuss!**

**Immediate Action:** Choose NOW: Hide (DC 17 Stealth), Prepare ambush 
(ready actions), or Flee (move away quickly)
**Success:** Hide: They pass by. Ambush: Surprise round. Flee: Avoid encounter.
**Failure:** Hide: They spot you (they get surprise). Flee: They chase 
you (running combat).
**Spotlight:** Rogue, All
**Skills:** Stealth, Tactics
**Threat Level:** Moderate - can be avoided
```

**Result:** Creates urgency, demands immediate action, rewards quick thinking.

#### COMBAT (Sum 91)
```
## Sum: 91 - COMBAT

### Ghouls Feasting

**Description:** You come upon 2 Ghoul Stalkers feasting on a fresh 
morlock corpse. They're completely focused on their meal.

**Ecology:** The creatures are distracted by food. Blood and gore everywhere.
**Creatures:** 2x Ghoul Stalker (Level 2)
**Difficulty:** Low (2 levels below party)
**Tactical Option:** DC 15 Stealth to sneak past OR surprise round if you attack
**Avoidable:** Yes
**Surprise Available:** Yes
**Floor Ecology:** Ghouls are stuck in an endless loop: collect flesh, 
eat flesh, need more flesh.

**GM Notes:** Shows dungeon ecology. Ghouls have needs and behaviors. 
Can be avoided with stealth.
```

**Result:** Shows living dungeon, offers tactical options, can be avoided, 
drains resources without TPK.

## What Changed in Practice

### Before (V1)
**Player behavior:**
- "I cast Detect Magic" (every room)

**Player behavior:**
- "I use Survival to track them!"
- "Should we take the fast route or the safe route?"
- "I'll use Performance to distract the guards!"
- "Oh no, patrol approaching! Quick, hide!"
- "Look, they're fighting each other! Let's wait..."

**GM satisfaction:**
- Players using diverse skills
- Meaningful choices every encounter
- Combat is one option, not the only option
- Dungeon feels alive and dynamic

## Success Stories (Predicted)

### Scenario 1: The Locked Door

**Old System:** "You encounter a patrol. Roll initiative."

**New System:** "You hear a patrol approaching! You have seconds to act!"
- Players hide (Stealth) - avoid combat entirely
- Players prepare ambush - get surprise round
- Players flee - running combat
- Choice matters, multiple solutions

### Scenario 3: The Feeding Ghouls
**Old System:** "You see 2 ghouls. Roll initiative."

**New System:** "You see 2 ghouls feasting on a corpse. They're distracted."
- Shows dungeon ecology (ghouls eat)
- Can sneak past (Stealth)
- Can ambush (surprise round)
- Can wait and observe
- Multiple approaches, all valid
