# Dungeon Exploration Guide for Players

## The Dice Jar System

### How It Works
Every time you spend **10 minutes** doing something in the dungeon, the GM adds **1 die** to a jar. When the jar reaches **5 dice**, the GM rolls all of them and something happens based on the total.

### What Adds Dice?
- Searching a room thoroughly
- Treating wounds
- Picking complex locks
- Studying inscriptions or maps
- Setting up traps or defenses
- Resting or taking breaks
- Moving between floors (up or down stairs)
- Any activity that takes about 10 minutes

Common 10-minute exploration activities include:
- **Avoid Notice** - Sneaking through areas
- **Defend** - Protecting the party while they work
- **Detect Magic** - Repeatedly casting Detect Magic
- **Hustle** - Moving at double speed (Constitution × 10 minutes)
- **Investigate** - Using Recall Knowledge to discover clues
- **Refocus** - Regaining 1 Focus Point
- **Repeat a Spell** - Repeatedly casting the same spell
- **Scout** - Ranging ahead to spot danger
- **Search** - Looking for hidden doors, traps, and secrets
- **Track** - Following tracks or trails
- **Treat Wounds** - Healing the party (takes 10 minutes per person)

For the complete list of exploration activities, see [Archives of Nethys: Exploration Activities](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=470).

**Important:** Most exploration activities take 10 minutes, which means they add 1 die to the jar. Plan accordingly!

### What Doesn't Add Dice?
- Quick actions (looking around, opening unlocked doors)
- Combat (tracked separately)
- Moving through rooms quickly
- Brief conversations

## Prepared Tokens - Strategic Time Investment

### What Are Prepared Tokens?
Some events let you spend extra time preparing, earning a **Prepared Token**. This token can be spent later to **reduce time costs** - you add 1 fewer die to the jar next time (minimum 0).

### How to Get Tokens
**Basic Exploration Activities that can get you tokens**
All of the following basic exploration abilities now provide:
+1 Prepared Token

*Scout*
Traits:Concentrate Exploration 
Source Player Core pg. 439
You scout ahead and behind the group to watch danger, moving at half speed. At the start of the next encounter, every creature in your party gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls.

*Cover Tracks*
Traits:Concentrate Exploration Move 
Source Player Core pg. 246
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed. You don't need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.

*Track*
Concentrate Exploration Move 
Source Player Core pg. 246
You follow tracks, moving at up to half your travel Speed. After a successful check to Track, you can continue following the tracks at half your Speed without attempting additional checks for up to 1 hour.

In some cases, you might Track in an encounter. In this case, Track is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait, but you might need to roll more often because you're in a tense situation. The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.

You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking, once every hour you continue tracking, and any time something significant changes in the trail. The GM determines the DCs for such checks, depending on the freshness of the trail, the weather, and the type of ground.

Success You find the trail or continue to follow the one you're already following.
Failure You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
Critical Failure You lose the trail and can't try again for 24 hours.

**Event Driven Tokens**

*Tactical Preparation:* 
When you find defensive positions or tactical advantages but no immediate combat, you can spend 10 minutes (ADD 1 DIE) preparing fallback plans and earn a token.

*Thorough Analysis:* 
Some events offer a "quick" option (5 min) or "thorough" option (10 min). The thorough option gives you the benefit PLUS a Prepared token.

*Efficient Information Gathering:* 
When you successfully gather information or assistance, you automatically earn a Prepared token - you learned something useful!

### How to Use Tokens
When you would normally add dice to the jar, you can **spend a Prepared token** to add 1 fewer die (minimum 0).

**Example:**
- You find a defensive position with no enemies nearby
- You spend 10 minutes preparing fallback positions (ADD 1 DIE, gain token)
- Later, moving between floors would cost 1 die
- You spend your Prepared token and add 0 dice instead
- Net result: You prepared for the future at no time cost!

### Why This Matters
**Invest time when safe, save time when dangerous!**
- Prepare when you have breathing room
- Use tokens when time pressure is high
- Rewards tactical thinking beyond immediate combat
- Makes "boring" preparation feel valuable

### Tracking Tokens
Mark Prepared tokens on your character sheet or party tracker. You can hold multiple tokens and spend them separately. They don't expire - save them for when you really need them!

## Why This Matters

**Time is a resource!** The more time you spend, the more likely something will happen. You need to balance:
- **Thoroughness** (searching everything) vs **Speed** (moving quickly)
- **Preparation** (setting traps, healing) vs **Urgency** (getting through fast)
- **Caution** (being careful) vs **Boldness** (taking risks)

---

## What Can Happen?

The dice jar can trigger different types of events:

### Good Things (Low Rolls)
- **Opportunities:** Find shortcuts, supplies, helpful NPCs, or tactical advantages
- **Rewards:** Using your skills creatively pays off!

### Challenges (Middle Rolls)
- **Complications:** Locked doors, unstable floors, magical wards - problems you need to solve
- **Dilemmas:** Tough choices where you have to pick between two options (fast vs safe, loud vs quiet)
- **Active Threats:** Immediate danger! Patrols approaching, floors collapsing, alarms ringing

### Danger (High Rolls)
- **Combat:** Actual fights with monsters
- **But:** Even combat encounters can often be avoided with clever thinking!

---

## Your Skills Matter!

The dungeon rewards using **ALL** your skills, not just combat abilities:

### Skills You Should Use
- **Acrobatics:** Balance across unstable floors, tumble through tight spaces
- **Athletics:** Climb walls, force open doors, swim through flooded areas
- **Crafting:** Repair items, build traps, understand mechanisms
- **Deception:** Lie to guards, create diversions, disguise yourselves
- **Diplomacy:** Negotiate with creatures, gather information, make allies
- **Intimidation:** Scare off enemies, coerce information, demoralize foes
- **Medicine:** Treat wounds, identify poisons, diagnose conditions
- **Nature:** Identify plants/animals, find food/water, predict weather
- **Occultism/Arcana:** Understand magic, identify spells, dispel wards
- **Performance:** Entertain guards, impersonate others, distract enemies
- **Religion:** Understand religious symbols, deal with undead, recall deity lore
- **Society:** Recall knowledge about cultures, decipher writing, understand customs
- **Stealth:** Sneak past enemies, hide from patrols, move silently
- **Survival:** Track creatures, find safe paths, sense direction
- **Thievery:** Pick locks, disable traps, palm objects

## Combat Is Optional

Many encounters can be **avoided** or **resolved without fighting**:

### Ways to Avoid Combat
- **Stealth:** Sneak past enemies who haven't noticed you
- **Diplomacy:** Talk your way out of fights
- **Intimidation:** Scare enemies into backing down
- **Deception:** Trick enemies into leaving or looking elsewhere
- **Distraction:** Create diversions to slip past
- **Waiting:** Let enemies pass by or finish what they're doing

### When You Do Fight
- Look for **tactical advantages** (high ground, cover, traps)
- Use the **environment** (oil to spill, chandeliers to drop)
- Consider **surprise rounds** (ambush distracted enemies)
- Remember **retreat is an option** (live to fight another day)

## Making Choices

You'll face many **dilemmas** where you have to choose:

### Common Trade-offs
- **Fast vs Safe:** Quick route (risky) or slow route (safer)
- **Loud vs Quiet:** Force door open (fast, noisy) or pick lock (slow, silent)
- **Now vs Later:** Loot now (takes time) or mark for later (might be gone)
- **Help vs Ignore:** Free prisoner (time cost, potential ally) or leave them
- **Fight vs Flee:** Combat now (while fresh) or avoid (they might reinforce later)

### No "Right" Answer
These choices have **trade-offs**. Think about:
- How much time do we have?
- How are our resources (HP, spells, items)?
- What are the consequences of each choice?
- What's our goal right now?

## The Living Dungeon

Monsters aren't just waiting around to fight you. They have **lives**:

### What You Might See
- **Feeding:** Creatures eating, distracted by their meal
- **Fighting:** Two groups of monsters fighting each other
- **Sleeping:** Exhausted creatures resting
- **Working:** Monsters hauling supplies, repairing things
- **Patrolling:** Guards making their rounds
- **Arguing:** Internal conflicts and disagreements
- **Rituals:** Ceremonies or magical practices

### How to Use This
- **Distracted enemies** are easier to sneak past or ambush
- **Fighting monsters** might weaken each other
- **Sleeping creatures** can be avoided entirely
- **Working monsters** might not be hostile if you don't threaten them
- **Patrols** have predictable routes you can learn

## Tips for Success

### 1. Communicate
Talk to your party! Discuss options before acting. But when there's **immediate danger**, act fast!

### 2. Be Creative
Think outside the box. The GM rewards creative solutions. Don't just default to "I attack."

### 3. Use Your Character
If you're a Rogue, use Thievery and Stealth. If you're a Cleric, use Religion and Medicine. Everyone has unique skills!

### 4. Track Resources
Keep an eye on HP, spell slots, and items. Sometimes avoiding a fight is smarter than winning it.

### 5. Learn from Consequences
Your choices matter. If you trigger an alarm, enemies will be alert. If you help someone, they might help you later.

### 6. Ask Questions
"Can I use Crafting to brace this floor?" "Can I use Performance to distract the guards?" The answer is often YES!

### 7. Don't Rush
But also don't dawdle. Find the balance between thorough and efficient.

### 8. Retreat Is Valid
If things go badly, running away is a legitimate strategy. Live to fight another day.
