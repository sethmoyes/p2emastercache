# Dungeon Exploration Guide for Players

## The Dice Jar System

### How It Works
Every time you spend **10 minutes** doing something in the dungeon, the GM adds **1 die** to a jar. When the jar reaches **5 dice**, the GM rolls all of them and something happens based on the total.

### What Adds Dice?
- Searching a room thoroughly
- Treating wounds
- Picking complex locks
- Studying inscriptions or maps
- Setting up traps or defenses
- Resting or taking breaks
- Any activity that takes about 10 minutes

### What Doesn't Add Dice?
- Quick actions (looking around, opening unlocked doors)
- Combat (tracked separately)
- Moving through rooms quickly
- Brief conversations

---

## Why This Matters

**Time is a resource!** The more time you spend, the more likely something will happen. You need to balance:
- **Thoroughness** (searching everything) vs **Speed** (moving quickly)
- **Preparation** (setting traps, healing) vs **Urgency** (getting through fast)
- **Caution** (being careful) vs **Boldness** (taking risks)

---

## What Can Happen?

The dice jar can trigger different types of events:

### Good Things (Low Rolls)
- **Opportunities:** Find shortcuts, supplies, helpful NPCs, or tactical advantages
- **Rewards:** Using your skills creatively pays off!

### Challenges (Middle Rolls)
- **Complications:** Locked doors, unstable floors, magical wards - problems you need to solve
- **Dilemmas:** Tough choices where you have to pick between two options (fast vs safe, loud vs quiet)
- **Active Threats:** Immediate danger! Patrols approaching, floors collapsing, alarms ringing

### Danger (High Rolls)
- **Combat:** Actual fights with monsters
- **But:** Even combat encounters can often be avoided with clever thinking!

---

## Your Skills Matter!

The dungeon rewards using **ALL** your skills, not just combat abilities:

### Skills You Should Use
- **Acrobatics:** Balance across unstable floors, tumble through tight spaces
- **Athletics:** Climb walls, force open doors, swim through flooded areas
- **Crafting:** Repair items, build traps, understand mechanisms
- **Deception:** Lie to guards, create diversions, disguise yourselves
- **Diplomacy:** Negotiate with creatures, gather information, make allies
- **Intimidation:** Scare off enemies, coerce information, demoralize foes
- **Medicine:** Treat wounds, identify poisons, diagnose conditions
- **Nature:** Identify plants/animals, find food/water, predict weather
- **Occultism/Arcana:** Understand magic, identify spells, dispel wards
- **Performance:** Entertain guards, impersonate others, distract enemies
- **Religion:** Understand religious symbols, deal with undead, recall deity lore
- **Society:** Recall knowledge about cultures, decipher writing, understand customs
- **Stealth:** Sneak past enemies, hide from patrols, move silently
- **Survival:** Track creatures, find safe paths, sense direction
- **Thievery:** Pick locks, disable traps, palm objects

### Don't Just Spam Detect Magic!
Yes, it's useful, but there are SO many other ways to solve problems. Be creative!

## Combat Is Optional

Many encounters can be **avoided** or **resolved without fighting**:

### Ways to Avoid Combat
- **Stealth:** Sneak past enemies who haven't noticed you
- **Diplomacy:** Talk your way out of fights
- **Intimidation:** Scare enemies into backing down
- **Deception:** Trick enemies into leaving or looking elsewhere
- **Distraction:** Create diversions to slip past
- **Waiting:** Let enemies pass by or finish what they're doing

### When You Do Fight
- Look for **tactical advantages** (high ground, cover, traps)
- Use the **environment** (oil to spill, chandeliers to drop)
- Consider **surprise rounds** (ambush distracted enemies)
- Remember **retreat is an option** (live to fight another day)

## Making Choices

You'll face many **dilemmas** where you have to choose:

### Common Trade-offs
- **Fast vs Safe:** Quick route (risky) or slow route (safer)
- **Loud vs Quiet:** Force door open (fast, noisy) or pick lock (slow, silent)
- **Now vs Later:** Loot now (takes time) or mark for later (might be gone)
- **Help vs Ignore:** Free prisoner (time cost, potential ally) or leave them
- **Fight vs Flee:** Combat now (while fresh) or avoid (they might reinforce later)

### No "Right" Answer
These choices have **trade-offs**. Think about:
- How much time do we have?
- How are our resources (HP, spells, items)?
- What are the consequences of each choice?
- What's our goal right now?

## The Living Dungeon

Monsters aren't just waiting around to fight you. They have **lives**:

### What You Might See
- **Feeding:** Creatures eating, distracted by their meal
- **Fighting:** Two groups of monsters fighting each other
- **Sleeping:** Exhausted creatures resting
- **Working:** Monsters hauling supplies, repairing things
- **Patrolling:** Guards making their rounds
- **Arguing:** Internal conflicts and disagreements
- **Rituals:** Ceremonies or magical practices

### How to Use This
- **Distracted enemies** are easier to sneak past or ambush
- **Fighting monsters** might weaken each other
- **Sleeping creatures** can be avoided entirely
- **Working monsters** might not be hostile if you don't threaten them
- **Patrols** have predictable routes you can learn

## Tips for Success

### 1. Communicate
Talk to your party! Discuss options before acting. But when there's **immediate danger**, act fast!

### 2. Be Creative
Think outside the box. The GM rewards creative solutions. Don't just default to "I attack."

### 3. Use Your Character
If you're a Rogue, use Thievery and Stealth. If you're a Cleric, use Religion and Medicine. Everyone has unique skills!

### 4. Track Resources
Keep an eye on HP, spell slots, and items. Sometimes avoiding a fight is smarter than winning it.

### 5. Learn from Consequences
Your choices matter. If you trigger an alarm, enemies will be alert. If you help someone, they might help you later.

### 6. Ask Questions
"Can I use Crafting to brace this floor?" "Can I use Performance to distract the guards?" The answer is often YES!

### 7. Don't Rush
But also don't dawdle. Find the balance between thorough and efficient.

### 8. Retreat Is Valid
If things go badly, running away is a legitimate strategy. Live to fight another day.
