# Otari Market

*One-stop shop for basic goods*

**Proprietor:** Keeleno Lathenar (dour, humorless human merchant)

**Description:** Part open-air farmer's market, part log-cabin trading post. Keeleno pays handsomely for wolf pelts, as a wolf-like monster slew his wife years ago, and he hopes to one day acquire the skin of her killer.

**Specialties:** All adventuring gear, light armor, and simple weapons
