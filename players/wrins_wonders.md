# Wrin's Wonders

*Eccentric tiefling-elf oddities merchant and stargazer*

**Proprietor:** Wrin Sivinxi (CG female tiefling elf oddities merchant 5)

**Description:** This odd, domed building is always open. Wrin is a bit unusual, seeing menace in every corner and truths in the constellations above, but she's eager to get to know adventurers and show off the many magical trinkets in her collection.

**Specialties:** Adventuring gear and magic items
